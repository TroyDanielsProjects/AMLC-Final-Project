Inject it into my veins. Three games going on right now.
As we record, we'll be checking in periodically.
Let's say hi to the gentleman first.
Ryan Whitney, we'll go to you first.
Where are you right now?
How are you guys?
I'm at Pinehurst.
It's actually, I don't know if I'm getting this right.
It might be the home of American golf.
Beautiful place.
I'm here with 11 buddies.
So as everyone parties and drinks and watches the playoffs and gambles,
you know what I did? I played golf,
and I came in here, and I prepared,
and I looked up what we're going to talk about,
and I'm ready to go. Here we go.
Next up, Paul Bissonnette. Dude, you
are all over the fucking internet lately.
Every time I turn around, new video dropping,
new content dropping. Where are you right now?
I'm in Toronto. I did
that fun content piece with john
scott i don't know if you guys watch it but it is on youtube uh through sportsnet you can check out
my twitter uh sportsnet and amazon it was uh we we raised sambonis in toronto uh john scott was
lucky enough to beat me i think i had a slower machine though so you guys can watch the video
and uh and uh you know make your own uh
your own predictions or not predictions what i mean your own assessment of of what went down but
yeah what's up i watched it it was funny i was laughing like the hairpin the hairpin turn you
took is was that like hard or no it was just natural yeah it was just weird i mean we got a few uh test laps just to outline
the course with the zambonis but driving them is is definitely hard the the center of gravity on
them is is more towards the back so like it's almost like the the front just turns faster so
anyway i i thought i did okay once again i do think my machine was a little bit slower so john
scott uh congratulations on your victory.
Yeah, I got that meet and greet tomorrow,
and then on Monday doing that NHL first-timer game three
of the Leafs-Boston series.
Folks, as we mentioned last pod,
we will be breaking down the games that are going on right now
while we're recording on Wednesday night,
especially the Eastern ones,
because those will be finished by the time we're done recording.
Of course, we still have the three
playoff series that break down that start on
Thursday. We are excited
and great to see you, fellas.
We'll be doing those previews in a second.
Last but not least, our producer,
Mikey Grinelli. What's up there, brother?
What's up, boys? Guys, I'd just like to
make a special anniversary
to our guy, Paul Bissonette.
One year ago today when the podcast dropped is when he joined us.
What?
Biz, you've taken us to the promised land, and we can't thank you enough, buddy.
It's been a fun run.
Boys, it's been such a fun run and how ironic that we dropped the Avery content
just before our one-year anniversary.
People are loving that one.
Some people are hating it,
but we don't care about those types of people.
And we'll also be doing a Biz20 20 off sale
on all Spittin' Chicklets merch
for this Thursday, April 11th
on the one-year anniversary.
So, I mean, we're dropping a ton
of new playoff merch right now.
Johnny Hammond, she's sure.
It's Russian Mafia shirt,
so go get some, 20 off.
And just a reminder to all you people out there,
never go up to a strange woman on the street with a Boston Bruins shirt
and ask them if she knows who Rear Admiral is
because she will tell you to go fuck yourself.
That was unbelievable.
Yeah, that could sound wrong.
We do have a guest coming up a little later.
You played with him at BU, right, Brandon?
Yep.
Didn't you play with him?
Or was he after you?
So Yipper, we missed playing with each other.
But he went on to win a national title at BU.
Incredible group of guys he was on the team with there.
A lot of NHLers. He goes into that.
And this is one of those things that I've brought up a bunch of times
where I have a lot of fun, and I think you guys do too,
interviewing buddies of mine, close personal friends
that maybe didn't play a huge role in the NHL,
but have had pretty cool, interesting careers.
And Yipper spent some time in the NHL, but he's a great guy.
And now he's playing over in China.
He talks a lot about playing, and he's Asian.
He'll go into how he's a Fasian, actually.
That's very funny.
But either way, I think that a lot of people are going to see
that we have some interviews coming up with friends of mine
who play pro hockey and still play pro hockey
that aren't well-known names.
But if you listen to them, I think you'll enjoy them.
Grinelli, I said to you after, I'm like,
did you think that was as good as I did?
You thought it was awesome.
Yeah, I thought it was unbelievable.
And just the type of guy Brandon Yip is,
after we went out that night in Boston on Thursday night,
I just had one message on my phone the next day from him,
Instagram DM, just saying, dot, dot, dot, what a league.
Yeah, so Yip is the man.
And I say this, and it kind of sounds like I'm trying to defend
if people are chirping that, oh, you don't have NHL all-starters on?
Who is this?
I actually don't give a fuck because it's our podcast
and I have a lot of fun interviewing my buddies.
But I think if you give it a chance, everyone will enjoy it.
And so Yipper was a blast, and we appreciate him coming on.
I actually had a different DM on Instagram from him.
He wrote, dot, dot, dot, what happened?
I blacked out.
So I don't know what happened to Yipper that night,
but he disappeared out of thin air.
And I'm glad that he found his way home.
So what do we got here?
By the way, quickly before we move on,
the big spit and chiclet sign is just like when you're at a club
and you have like bottles and signs coming out,
that's the worst look in the world if you ask me.
Like I'll never.
I remember when I used to rip up clubs.
When I used to rip up clubs, I said, hey, yeah, we need some more bottles.
Do not even fucking think about bringing a sprinkler.
What are they called?
Sparkler.
Sparkler.
They brought that thing over.
The fire alarm went off.
They brought that thing over.
And you guys, I was so happy.
And you guys looked like you both wanted
to kill me i ran away i would have strangled you and fucking popped your eyes out like the
mountain to the viper in game of thrones if i could have at that moment but you know i didn't
tell them to do that i did not tell them to do that that was done no we didn't say you did i just
i'm one to if i'm going to the club and i'm going to do stuff i i want it dark in the corner and
and uh let's get into the dark stuff.
Not like, hey, where's the laser light show?
I want everyone to see that I'm buying a bottle of Grey Goose.
That's why I'm not a club guy right there.
Quick score update, actually.
Tampa Bay up 3-1 after 2.
Islanders and Penguins 2-2 in the second.
And Winnipeg up 1-0 after 1.
And I wonder if Patrick Liney is a spitting chicklets list.
He got a little fired up with Monday's episode.
Hey, shove it up my ass.
Hey, listen, anytime I criticize a hockey player on this podcast
about their game, I want nothing more than for them to shove it
right up my hoop.
Do it.
Go light the lamp.
It was a beautiful goal by Liney.
Just a flick of the wrist bar down, and you're going to have to
shoot like that in order to beat Ben Nasty
in that net for St. Louis.
So that's definitely a series
that has already gotten chippy. We don't
want to get to the breakdowns just yet. Let's move
on to the playoff series analysis
for the Thursday games. Exactly. Potential
monkey off the back, though.
Yeah, after five series kicked off last night,
we got three more starting tonight, Thursday, and now we're going to take a closer look at each one first up we got a
rematch of last year's highly entertaining first round series between the toronto maple leafs and
my boston bruins uh this is their third matchup in the last seven years with the bruins winning
the first two and seven games each uh money wise the bruins are a six seven favorite which is 140
to make 100 on the Bruins or 100 to make
120 on Toronto the season series the Bruins took that three to one Toronto hasn't made the second
round since 2004 it's been a while Bruins allowed the third fewest goals per game this year while
Toronto was fourth in scoring goals per game so it's kind of like a resistible force a movable
object type thing here we got obviously Rask and Anderson.
That's the big duel.
Neither one was good in the series last year.
It was a very run-and-gun series.
Each goalie was kind of the inverse of the other this year.
Rask started slow, got hot.
Anderson was hot early, kind of tailed off late.
So going to be interesting to see what version we got.
Biz, what do you got on this one?
Wow, this one, there's a lot to break down.
A lot of storylines on the Toronto side.
Of course, Nylander getting paid.
Didn't have the best playoff last year.
Of course, a lot of expectations come out of the Matthews.
Tavares is, I mean, to me, going to be the biggest difference.
Considering that series went to seven games last year
and they didn't have Johnny T,
very interesting to now add him into that mix.
Another storyline is, I mean, you know,
Jake Gardner needing to bounce back.
I know he's coming back from injury.
I don't know how much that's affecting him.
Another storyline is how is Anderson going to play?
He had that tough game seven last year.
And last but not least, man, I'd say there's a little bit of pressure
on Babcock too.
I mean, when's he going to turn the corner with this group
of Toronto players?
To break down the Leafs more, because I know you guys are going to want
to do Boston, I would give slight advantage as as old overall skill and depth up front to Toronto
and some people may think I'm crazy that's fine as far as the back end's concerned I mean I'd call
it a wash I mean them adding Muzzin was huge depending on the health of Dermott who came back
and Gardner of course who we don't know how his injury is lagging on,
will determine on how they actually play and how much pressure will be maybe on a guy like Morgan Riley
if those guys aren't 100.
So very interested to see how the D matchups come out,
D pairings, I should say.
And then, as I said, goaltending.
I'm feeling a big year for Anderson in playoffs.
Now, I'm going to pass it over to Witt for the Boston breakdown,
and then I'll give you guys my overall breakdown
of who I think will win that series.
Yeah, it's probably the most anticipated first-round matchup.
You know, original six and also how good both teams are.
I went on Toronto Sports Radio, and we were talking.
I want to say it was February-ish, and we were kind of talking,
you know, Bruins, Leafs.
I went into the point of that Toronto should have confidence this year
that it's pretty much the same team, you know, adding Tavares and Muzzin, right?
Like, we got to Game 7 against this team, and we, adding Tavares and Muzzin, right? Like we got to game seven against this team and we added two spectacular
pieces. One being, you know, a legit, you know, superstar and Tavares.
But then the Bruins went on that run and it was a 15-0-4 run in the year.
They got points in 19 straight games.
And the craziest part about the entire situation for Boston for me
was that, I mean, not one guy on the team played in all 82 games, right?
They dealt with injuries to almost every key player on the team.
I know Bergeron missed time, Chara missed time, Postranok missed time,
and it's like they just kept winning.
The train kept rolling.
Choo, choo, choo, choo.
Here I'm the Bruins down the tracks.
So the fact that they never slowed down with key guys being out,
I almost said  well, I did say to myself, like,
I don't know if Toronto can beat these guys.
And the one issue is that, like, Toronto, for me,
I look at a team that has a ton of skill.
I don't think their D is,
is great.
Um,
I think they got some good players,
but there's also kind of a lack of depth a little bit,
I would say.
And Anderson is a little bit of a question mark.
The Bruins on the other,
on the other hand,
Rask has been great.
And people say Rask in the playoffs,
the questions arise,
you know,
how will he be?
He's gotta be better. It's like the first bad goal Rask gives up, Rask in the playoffs, the questions arise. How will he be? He's got to be better. It's like the first
bad goal Rask gives up,
the Bruins fans go
bananas. Well, he may not
give up another one the rest of the game, but
even if he struggles, Halak
was so good this year. I mean, what a
signing and what a job by the Bruins
to bring that guy in. And it's
insurance. And you remember Halak, and this
is a long time ago, but fucking people in Montreal were saying, and it's insurance. And you remember Halak, and this is a long time ago,
but fucking people in Montreal were saying trade Carey Price.
Keep Halak.
This guy has done it in the playoffs. And no matter if it was eight, nine, ten years ago,
they have a backup plan in case Tuca really does struggle.
So there's so much more to go into in this entire series,
but Boston being as good as they were this year really did surprise me.
I thought they were a playoff team.
I didn't think they were this good.
But they have not slowed down no matter what adversity they've hit.
And for them to have home ice, I just think they're not a huge favorite,
but definitely the favorite in this series.
I mean, would you guys agree that even Leafs fans would say
that the Bruins are the favorites here?
Yeah, I don't see how you can say they're not the favorites right now.
I mean, if you want to rely on the season series,
the Bruins had them 3-1 there.
They had a better record than them.
I think just even on paper, they're a better team.
Toronto's D last players, that was an absolute disaster.
They should be better.
Like Biz said, they picked up Jake Muzzin.
I still give the Bruins the overall edge.
Like you said, the D depth just isn't really that great.
The Bruins, I think they're spread
out pretty nice. As far as forwards,
they're loads of talent on both teams.
But, you know, Toronto, I mean,
they got Nazem Kadri as their third
center. That's not too shabby when you get a
30-goal score as your third center.
I actually give the edge and
forwards to Toronto. I agree with you there.
You know, I mean, you got Oscar Matthews,
Tavares, I mean,
Nylander, and Marner.
I mean, that's ridiculous talent.
I know we got Pasta, Bergeron, Marchand.
And I'll tell you who to keep an eye on is David Krejci, man.
He had his best season in probably four or five years, I'd say.
He looked good out there.
He didn't really have any injuries this year.
And if you remember the two seasons the Bruins went to the Stanley Cup,
he was the leading scorer in both seasons, and 2013 so uh keep an eye on him uh you know we've already had two fun series this decade with these two
teams I'd expect another uh the Bruins have looked almost unbeatable in the last couple months I I
don't think that we could say the same for Toronto so I'm also expecting the same result except in
six this time instead of seven I got Bruins in All right, great point about David Krejci.
And this is a guy who, like you said,
really just had such a key part of leading those teams to the Cup,
winning the Cup Finals.
He actually tied his career high in 73 points this year.
And he's 32 years old.
He turns 33 at some point in April.
It might have already happened.
But incredible year by him.
And for me looking at this, I mean, I'm picking the Bruins.
I'm saying seven.
I mean, I don't think anyone would be surprised in the least to see this series go seven,
the way these kind of teams have battled back and forth.
And for me, I'm going to pick two guys that I'm really watching,
and I think that this is a huge playoff for them.
In Toronto, it's Austin Matthews.
Last year, it was two points in the seven games,
and he signs the huge ticket.
Incredible player, world-class talent.
But in a market like Toronto, you have another seven-game series,
six-game series, you get two points, questions, here they come.
And then on the Boston side, I'm actually looking at Charlie McAvoy.
And I think that for him to hop out of BU and join that playoff run against Ottawa,
he played great.
He looked awesome.
Last year, he didn't have a great playoff.
And I think he'll be the first to tell you he was battling injury.
It was a tough time.
And I think that he's going to dominate.
I think he's going to kind of come in and be that defenseman that plays 25 minutes a game in the playoffs
and is playing power play PK and
a true number one D-man for the Bruins. And if
he does do that,
they're going to move on. I mean, I'm not saying
he's the only reason they would, but
he's a huge part of the Bruins team, and I think he's
going to take a huge step.
Who you got?
Bruins in seven.
Okay.
Going back to Rask too I would I would say that last year I know that series went to seven games but I would say Boston fans uh would agree that the reason it
did so was Rask did struggle in that series against the Leafs he was not very good um you
know luckily the offense bailed him out. No room for error for him.
He's got to be sharp in this series and help that team out.
You mentioned it too.
With Halak as a backup, nice little signing by the Bees
to have a guy to go to if things do go south and net quick.
I would say the Bees' overall team game, it's battle-tested.
They play better team defense.
That's my opinion.
So I will give them the edge on that.
Leafs not taking the underdog title lightly, though.
They're saying, we're very confident in this group.
We're not taking that label in here.
Number two going against number three.
We weren't far off this season.
Guys, my assessment of it is this.
I have the same feeling of this series as I did of the Pittsburgh-Washington series last year.
I have a feeling that for whatever reason it may be,
the Leafs are going to win this series in seven games.
And all signs point to Boston, and I will concede and say that is the better team to me
based on our overall analysis.
I just  I got a feeling.
You said this.
Yeah.
What did you say?
Washed last year, right?
I just, I have that eerie feeling about it.
And as I said, Toronto, there's a lot to prove here from,
from, from goaltending to their back end, where it comes to Gardner.
He's got to step up.
Morgan Riley's got to show he's got to do it in playoffs.
And, of course, those two names up front that you mentioned
in Matthews and Nylander.
So that's what I got, boys.
I'm not just going against the grain because I just got this weird feeling.
Yeah, that's a theme that's going to come back later in these previews.
And one more note on the backup.
Should they really come into play?
Like we've mentioned, Talak was basically a 1A this year at Arrask.
While Toronto, they just brought in Michael Hutchinson.
They dropped Garrett Sparks down to the minors after his last appearance.
They picked up Hutchinson.
Now, he's a guy who hasn't played since January.
So they better hope Anderson's on his game because you don't really want to
throw a guy ice cold out there in the playoffs.
So just another little note.
And our boy Anderson just bought a nice gold AP off Larry Flowers,
a beautiful timepiece.
So I just feel like that's going to give him that extra little spark
walking into the rink with that confidence, that big swinging dick, baby.
All right, Andy, don't let me down, buddy.
All right.
Next is the final series in the East to kick off.
That's the Cup champs, Washington Capitals,
versus a team that hasn't been in the postseason for a decade,
the Carolina Hurricanes. Caps are a 7-8 favorite. It's not a huge favorite. That's 1.60 to make a buck on the Caps or 100 to make 140 on Carolina. The Caps won all four games in
the season series. But I think this is another interesting matchup, if only because we've never
seen the Canes here before, so we really don't know what to expect from them. They're a team
that has a phenomenal work ethic,
much like their coach when he played Rod Brindamore.
They kind of rotate a bunch of guys out here.
They've got some nice high-end talent.
Sebastian Auer had a 30-goal year.
Their goaltending, they're another two-headed monster,
similar to the Islanders.
They've got Mrazek and McElhinney.
They have a combined 13 playoff games played,
whereas Braden Holtby played in 23 playoff games just last season.
So that's a huge probably question mark for the Hurricanes.
But I don't know. I think that's a big story for this.
Whitney, what do you got on this one?
Am I crazy to think that everyone's not given Washington enough credit?
I feel like they could go repeat.
That's very hard, but I would be shocked if they lose this series,
so much so that before I even give you my little breakdown,
I'm taking Washington in five games.
I think Washington ran over them in every regular season game
they played against them this year.
They're a better team.
One thing that's a little wearisome,
They're a better team.
One thing that's a little wearisome,
and a lot of fringe hockey fans may say this doesn't matter.
They would be like, what are you talking about? But Michael Kempney is a defenseman who came over to Washington
and had a huge role in that team going to the Cup
and winning the Stanley Cup last year, and he's gone.
He's out for the year.
So Christian Jusopsen, he played like 10 minutes a game last year
when he was in the lineup on the run to the Cup.
So losing a defenseman of that caliber, I mean, it hurts.
It's a top four, maybe the fifth defenseman.
Either way, similar to Boston and Kevin Miller, it sucks.
And so that's a loss.
But looking past that, I mean, their offense and how hard they came on
at the end of the year and how good they looked
and hope he finished the season great too.
He was feeling it from the all-star break on,
and Jacob Braun is a guy who took that huge step,
a big year for him that I think when we interviewed Brooks Orpik,
he said the kid's unbelievable.
I mean, I remember him.
He was talking how good he is, and so it's no surprise.
But Washington, I mean mean they fucking did it last
year they finally figured it out and I think Carolina's had a hell of a year um I think that
they've had a special season and making the playoffs is great but I don't think they stand
a chance against this Caps team biz well I'm gonna start off by saying I wanted to issue an apology
to the Carolina Hurricanes fan base because I was a little bit critical of their
antics this season not not heavily like like Don Cherry I wasn't calling them jerks I just said you
know it wasn't uh wasn't my cup of tea and you know when they ended up clinching a playoff berth
just seeing the fans reactions and everything that considering that they've been through in
the last few years you know not having great teams not having much to root about after they'd last won their Stanley Cup. Seems like the hockey culture had kind of disappeared
there. And that team, Rob Brindamore and Justin Williams, what they have gone in there and done
and kind of shifted that culture has been pretty cool to see. And for a group of guys right here
on this podcast that, you know, all we're about is entertaining hockey fans and giving back to the
hockey community and growing the game and they're doing that in a place that's not traditional so
I want to apologize for being critical and I want to wish you guys luck against the Washington
Capitals and I hope you guys make a series of it now I'm going to start by breaking down the caps
and let's start with the goaltending i think that there is an advantage to be had
about the fact that they got it done as a pair this year very similar to the islanders goaltending
situation where they share the net so so none of them going into playoffs really burnt out i mean
i would imagine uh marazic gets to start he was pretty fired up when he got interviewed on the
bench after they uh after they had clinched i don't know if you guys saw that video there was a bunch of viral videos of their canes when they when they had the
one of brindamore getting confirmation that they had clinched uh marazic on the bench and of course
all the fans in the top section so um do i think that they have the goaltending advantage going in
fuck no but hey something to to maybe help their spirits is the fact that Mrazek will be fresh.
On to the D.
To me, I look at this D core, and if anything,
I might give them the slight advantage because they get it done by committee,
kind of like a poor man's Nashville.
And once again, that's not an insult.
They have four guys back there with 29 or more points, of course,
led by Dougie Hamilton, who had a big year
offensively, 18 tucks.
So if they're going to have any chance in this series, they're going to need that secondary
scoring from the back end for them to contribute.
Of course, Falk is another guy back there who hit double digits in goals.
I believe he had 11 this year, another puck-moving guy.
So they got some guys back there who can move.
North American decor, four American players, two Canadians. another puck moving guy so they got some guys back there who can move um a north american decor
four american players two canadians so uh as i said i would give them slight edge and up front
they got those few high-end guys but i mean man this is this is like a david versus goliath type
situation on the offense um in order for carolina to win series, everything is going to have to go right.
They're going to have to fucking dial it in mentally
and be disciplined, stay out of the box,
and as I said, just play the perfect series.
So, I mean, you've pretty much said it all about Washington.
We know exactly what they're bringing, R.A.,
and I'm going to have to go with Washington.
I'll be generous and say six.
Okay, wait, did you give a number? You said five, right? Captain Five? Okay. I'm going to have to go with Washington. I'll be generous and say six.
Okay, wait, did you give a number?
You said five, right?
Caps in five?
Okay.
Yeah, I agree, man.
Obviously, the Caps get the edge in offense.
In on defense, they're old.
They got seven guys with at least 20 goals.
I mean, the Canes are no slouch.
They had four guys who had at least 20.
On paper, I don't know how you pick against the Caps,
but you know what?
I think the Canes are just going to be one of those teams that doesn't stop coming. They're going to give them a series. I think they just have that kind of
Jenny Sequa right now where, I don't know, I could see them upsetting them. I could see maybe
the Capitals maybe a little sluggish after having such a long season last year. You know, they won
the Cup. They played well into June. I don't think anyone's really bringing that up. They could be
maybe a little tired or a little prone to be tired more than other teams. So I think the Canes are going to upset them.
I do.
I'm going to take the Canes in seven.
So I know that's off the grid a little bit.
Wow.
You've been picking a lot of upsets.
And, you know, before we got finished here tonight,
I wanted to go back on that.
I know.
Sorry to interrupt you.
I know this guy because if he gets one right,
he's going to go on fucking on and on.
I picked this one.
You take nine of them and one of them go.
Trust me, I know R.A. and how this is working.
I tell you what, after he gave his Dallas breakdown,
which we had to cover a lot of series.
I feel like we didn't give Dallas enough credit, and R.A. did.
And one thing I don't even know if you mentioned was the fact
that Zuccarello's coming back, and that's just another spark to the offense.
And then I was blathering on about
how good uh Nashville is uh defensively well I think Dallas was better as far as how many goals
they gave up last year so that totally went by my head so Bishop had a great season he got a great
backup there so all right you're going off the grid a little bit but at least you're bringing
some some good breakdown and and you might have shifted my opinion on the Dallas series.
Not so much this one, but I'll give you that.
Thanks, man.
Like you were saying about Toronto, on paper,
you don't know why you picked them.
Well, that's kind of my reason with the Canes.
I don't know.
There's just something about them.
I think they got a little magic or something, not to sound corny.
Me and R.A. just stroking each other off with the Canine brand CBD.
Just get a little fucking cane on there.
Off of his mother-in-law's foot.
Full foot job.
It is.
I know we weren't going to bring it up, but we're between series right now.
I don't, we've been sitting on our hands for the last half hour,
but Columbus was down three net.
And when we started these previews, they've scored three, I'm sorry,
three to one. They're down.
They scored three times since we've been talking
to take a 4-3 lead with two minutes
and a half. Buy off hockey, man. It's crazy.
I know that Columbus locker room believes in that.
That's not an easy team. They're not going to
lay down, boys.
Hey, guys, I already had some
stats ready.
When Tampa was up 3-0,
all of a sudden, I'm like, Jesus
Christ.
I saw this one stat.
The last President's Trophy winner to score three or more goals
in the first period of the first game of the playoffs
was the Avalanche in 96-97.
They led Chicago 3-0 after one period, and they won 6-0.
You know what happened, though?
Now Lightning are losing.
Are you shitting me with what's happened here?
And what's crazy, what's absolutely crazy is the Tampa Bay Lightning
have won their last 106 games when leading by three or more goals.
And all of a sudden now they're about to lose game one at home
against the pesky Blue Jackets, who I wouldn't be surprised in the least, who are down 3-0,
and maybe Tortorella or maybe Foligno or maybe anyone in that locker room
says, guys, we're in the playoffs.
We've got nothing to lose at this point.
We got in.
Fuck, let's play loose.
Let's go.
And I haven't seen the entire game, but to come back
and all of a sudden be up 4-3, that's crazy.
And when they were down 3-0, I went to live bet Columbus because
I said, hey, what the fuck? I mean, you know,
we always talk about how 3-0 is
a big comeback.
When I went to bet it, it was
3-1, but I still took Columbus on the live
bet plus 1,000.
Whoa.
Come on.
Did you put a nickel on it? No, I only fucking put
a chintzy-ass hundred on it.
Actually, my lag bet's a max to 200, so I can only put 200.
So what does that mean?
A hundred will win you a thousand?
Yeah.
When Columbus was down 3-1, I put a hundred on him to win a thousand, yeah.
Oh, man, I hope you win that bet already.
You're a savage, dude.
Fuck it, you know, when in Rome.
So, yeah, I figured we'd take a little, while we were in between series,
we'd take a little look at that game. And, Witt, you love this guy, went in Rome. So, yeah, I figured we'd take a little while we were in between series, we'd take a little look at that game.
And, Witt, you love this guy, your boy Anderson,
going and assisting this one so far.
You called it.
You said he needed to have a big series, and he's already been bringing it.
He's like that Hemsworth guy in the Avengers.
Oh, he's fucking handsome.
He's a handsome fellow.
He's fucking handsome, and he's jacked, and he plays like a complete savage.
So one and one.
He'll probably get a fight at the end of the game, too.
Hey, and let's not forget, too,
some of those guys in that Columbus lineup,
I know they don't have a resume at the NHL level as far as winning,
but they came up from that Calder Cup winning team,
the Lake Erie Monsters.
I played against them in that conference final of the West
when I was with the Ontario Reign, and Anderson was on that team.
He was a fucking beast.
Plays with a chip on his shoulder, but I was in his ear.
I'm not saying I'm like Mr. Fucking Crazy Tough Guy,
but I was barking in his ear, and he was looking at me like,
shut the fuck up and sit down.
He ain't scared of nothing.
He's old school, I guess.
And Wierenski was on that team, actually.
Yes, he was.
My good buddy Steve Eminger was on that club,
now a scout for the New York Rangers, doing well there.
And he was telling me, Wierenski, how good he was.
And apparently those games in Cleveland were like,
they were getting 18,000.
It was sold out. It was000. It was sold out.
It was nuts.
It was banana lands.
And that Wierenski, when I saw him play, I'm like, this guy's Jay Bomeester.
He's going to step in at a young age, and he's going to play a fucking 20-year career.
More offensive skill, too, I think.
Yeah, a little bit more natural offensive skill and just an overall great defenseman. And speaking of Bo Meester, who I just mentioned,
might as well segue it into his contract extension, R.A.
Yeah, absolutely.
Let me scroll down a little here.
Yeah, St. Louis defenseman Jay Bo Meester signed a one-year contract extension
for 3.25 million.
35-year-old was scheduled to be UFA this summer,
but he likes the situation in St. Louis.
The feeling was mutual, so he re-upped.
Three goals, 14 assists this past season.
He was paired with Colton Pareko as a shutdown pair for the last half of the season.
But, you know, he's a guy who's made a lot of money in his career,
so it was probably easy for him to, you know, take 3.25 million for this deal.
Well, let's go back to the start of the year.
Remember, he was healthy scratch for the first time in his career,
and then St. Louis Blues Twitter were ripping him apart,
and I stepped in and I said, hey, show some fucking respect.
This guy is the ultimate professional.
He shows up to the rink every day with his work boots on,
and he doesn't get away from the path.
He stays on it, puts his head down, and he fucking works.
And sure as shit, he turned his season around,
and I've been reading blues twitter
and and they're raving about him now all of a sudden so there's a guy you knew he was going
to turn things around especially older in his career and i'm so happy for that guy to get
another year extension and hopefully he can keep up that plagiarism playoff so bowmeister you're
awesome guy to me at training camp the one year when i came in as a water bottle filler adjuster
and you're a great guy we'll get you on the pause sometimes even though if we did get you on you
probably wouldn't even say a word during the whole thing unless you had 24 beers hey i'll tell you
right now too he's made so much goddamn cake that guy this 3.25 just so he can have some cash in his
car lying around for the rest of his life he's's like, all right, I'll just sign this one extra year.
That way every time I get my car washed,
I'll have some cash to hand out to these guys.
Hey, him and R.A. have the same wardrobe,
so you know he ain't spending any of that either.
Bollmeister was like my draft.
He was the biggest deal in the world, and I remember I met him.
He didn't say one word, and then all of a sudden we had some beers.
It was actually like the top prospects go to the draft biz,
like who they think is going to be high picks.
It was myself, Upshaw, Lupo, Jay Bollmeister.
And I forget the fifth if there was one.
And Bollmeister started having beers and all of a sudden he's like,
what's up, man?
How you doing?
Where you from, buddy?
Oh, yeah.
What's up for the summer?
I was like, what the?
He flips the switch when he has a couple pops.
How about that crew, though?
Loops and Uppy.
No one else got laid, I'm assuming.
I know.
I was the biggest nerd in the world.
Meanwhile, Loops and Uppy are just running around the WHL,
just crushing anything and everything.
It's like being the hottest guys in the league.
Meanwhile, I got an afro, the biggest ears in the world,
and I've never had a tan.
I think those are the first guys ever to frost their tips too.
And back then it was cool.
So, you know, they were just getting all the puss.
Let's, I think we should break down that Calgary, Colorado series,
which is, I put that as second to most anticipated
other than the Boston Toronto series.
That's my opinion anyway, R.A.
Well, as everybody knows, Game of Thrones is back Sunday night.
So it's only appropriate that we have a series of fire and ice as the calgary flames take on the colorado
word play you love it uh first ever postseason meeting of the two franchises uh the flames are
the second biggest favorite in round one uh 9-11 favorite favorite which means you have to put up
220 to make 100 on them or 100 to make 180 on Colorado.
Calgary won all three games of the season series.
Only Tampa had more points and scored more goals than Calgary this year.
The Flames have tons of weapons up front.
Goudreau, Kachok, Monaghan, Lindholm.
The only team that also had five players with at least 70 points.
Giordano was the fifth one there.
He's going to be a Norris finalist, probably going to win it.
They're solid on D.
I think the goaltender is another question mark.
You know, you've got 37-year-old Mike Smith.
Didn't have a great year, though he did finish strong.
26-year-old David Riddick, he's only got, I think,
three or four playoff games in his career.
I don't know.
It looks like Calgary on paper, but what do you got on this one, Biz?
I really like Calgary as far as their depth up front,
and I think that's what's going to lead the way.
Not only do they play with skill, speed, pace,
but they got some guys who can get to that net front,
some guys who play meat and potato style hockey.
So I feel like they have the perfect balanced lineup up front
for playoff hockey.
But, hey, playoffs is a different beast,
and it should be interesting to see if those guys can continue
that offensive pace because we do know after All-Star break,
Goudreau, Monaghan, and Limholm, they slowed down a little bit.
They weren't producing to that same rate they were at the start of the year
when things were going really well for them offensively.
Looking at the back end, I think they're solid.
Obviously, Giordano is the main topic of conversation when it comes to the back end for the Flames.
Everything kind of runs through him.
And I like where they're at there.
But, I mean, goaltending, we don't need to get into it.
This should be very, very interesting.
The good news for Calgary is have we gotten confirmation
on who's starting game one?
Not confirmation, but
it's going to be Mike Smith. That's what I
was assuming. And now, I mean, Riddick played
more games than him this season.
But hey, the minute
if Smitty has a bad game to open up
this series, I say they do
not hesitate. And they
go right to the backup.
I would say Smith has got a shorter leash than Rask.
I would say if Rask has a stinker, they're going to go back to him for one.
I don't know if you guys agree with that, but Mike Smith has a very small leash,
and game one will be very interesting.
And considering that Colorado, probably one of, if not the hottest team
coming into the playoffs, they're getting a big boost back in Rantanen.
That top line will be back together.
I would say the best line in hockey at the start of the year,
and it went together and healthy.
I would say they're better than the Bergeron line.
And I know you guys can disagree because they're a Boston team.
I know Brinelli's going to have fucking anthrax sent to my house
because I said that.
But, I mean, the problem with Colorado to me is just maybe a little bit soft
on the back end where they're going to get worked around by a team like Calgary
where they're second and third lines.
They can wear you down.
They cycle.
They play the big boy game, as I mentioned.
And just the depth up front.
Who's your pick?
I'm going to have to go Calgary in six games.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm excited for this one, too.
And I think it's great for Colorado that it looks like Ronson is going to be back.
That's just an incredible couple, you know,
three players with Landis, Guggen, McKinnon.
So to have him back, that's meaningful.
And what a year it was.
I'm the first to
admit I'm terrible at this, by the way.
A little off topic because it's a different team, but
Reeves texted me. He's like,
you motherfucker picking us.
You motherfucker.
I said,
the reason I just saw this is because I said
when Landis Kog
went down, I said Colorado's done.
And, you know, right when I said it, obviously they picked it up.
They got points in 10 of the last 11 games.
They come in on a high.
Exciting team.
We've talked about Tyson Barry.
What a year he had.
Incredible.
But I do agree with a little bit of the defense kind of struggling,
not moving the puck, but, you know, defensively a little bit.
I think that if you look at dealing with Calgary's offense,
it's going to be too much.
And I'm with you in a sense that, you know,
Goudreau and Monahan are one thing,
and you talk about Giordano and the seasons he had
and the season he has had and offensively how good he can be.
But Matthew Kachuk, man, I mean,
he kind of changes everything for this team a little bit
because you look at the fact that he makes everyone he plays against hate him.
And Drew Doughty's been the biggest story in terms of despising Matthew Kachuk
on the ice, but, dude, when you see anyone he plays against can't stand him,
and it's playoff hockey at its finest, and I think he's going to be great in that role.
The fact that this year he gets 34
goals, he gets 77 points.
Dude, this guy's not just a
pain in the ass. He can play. It's Marshawn
like, and to add that to the
Goudreau and Monaghan,
and maybe James Neal takes a step.
I actually shouldn't have said that.
Is he definitely healthy, Biz? Do you know?
You're asking the wrong guy.
Yeah, I mean, I'm not exactly sure.
But if he's ready to go, I mean, he's probably looking for a new start.
You know what I'm saying?
Yes.
After a tough regular season.
So I think it's going to be a great series.
Offensively, there's a ton of stuff to get excited about.
But I see Calgary getting this done in five, five, maybe six games.
I'll go with five because you said six.
Well, you mentioned the James Neal thing in a fresh start,
and already before I sent it over to you,
some people are like, well, why?
Are you just going to flip the switch?
It's weird because playoffs is played at such a different pace
than regular season.
All of a sudden, maybe all those bad tendencies you had in regular season
and all of a sudden not hitting your pockets in places
at the right specific times, all of a sudden that changes
because certain lanes are opened up that wouldn't be
because guys might be over back checking
or guys might be a little bit more tense or the game just a little bit faster.
So that lane ended up opening up sooner than it should have.
So who knows?
For a guy that's a pure goal scorer like James Neal,
maybe he finds his game.
And if he can get hot, then they just added a fucking another 30-goal guy
to their lineup for a guy who struggled all season.
And for anyone out there, it's like anytime you've played hockey,
no matter what level it is, if you do have a regular season
where things don't go your way you don't play great
no matter no matter where it is and no matter why it's happened your struggles you still can always
look and say oh my god i'm so fired up for the playoffs this is like a fresh start because have
a shitty regular season you go light it up in the playoffs no one remembers a thing so it's like a
it's like a fresh breath for guys who maybe didn't have the year they wanted and to get to the
playoffs you don't have a lot of guys who struggled but still there can be a certain breath for guys who maybe didn't have the year they wanted. And to get to the playoffs, you don't have a lot of guys who struggled. But still, there can be a certain amount of guys on
every team in the playoffs this year who's like, man, this is my time. Because this year didn't go
as I really had hoped for in the regular season. All of a sudden, I'm going to step it up in the
playoffs and nobody will remember a thing. And if Colorado does have a chance to win the series
already, I don't think we've talked about them enough, is the end of the season that Grubauer had.
What a pickup by them at the end of the season last year.
I believe that was involved in the Orpik deal,
where I don't exactly know the details, but what do you think of him?
It's funny.
I was just going to bring that up as a point.
First off, I just misread my own notes.
Riddick doesn't have any playoff history, so don't tweet me at that.
Yeah, I was like, I don't know about that one, but I didn't say a word.
I was actually, I'll get to it in a second.
It was Grubauer because he's, yeah, he went 9-2-2 down the stretch,
with a 9-5-6-8 percentage since February 23rd.
He'll probably get the start.
He's only got four career playoff games.
That's the thing I just misread.
Simeon Volomov used to be the start a long time. he's got 26 playoff games under his belt but none since 2014 uh whitney
miko ranthan is definitely going to be good to go i saw i checked out on twitter earlier so they're
going to be able to roll out one of the best lines in the game they scored 41 of colorado's goals
this season but after that it thins out uh quite a bit so if you know calgary is able to shut them
down it's going to be tough, I think,
for Colorado to beat them, basically.
Regardless, even if Calgary's goaltending is subpar,
I think they have so much offense and the lack of depth on Colorado,
I think that that's not really going to factor too much.
I see Calgary's goalies maybe even getting outplayed a bit,
but I just don't think the Avs have enough oomph on offense.
I got Calgary in six on this one.
All right.
And, R.A., congratulations.
You won your bet.
Wow, what a comeback by the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Seth Jones with the game winner.
And, boys, I mean, that big boy line, all the big boys for Tampa Bay
getting shut down in game one at home.
Thoughts on that?
I wouldn't panic at all.
I mean, I think that it's upsetting you get in the locker room,
but those guys are like, dude, it's over.
I mean, we'll grab a dinner, be ready.
Maybe a couple guys skate tomorrow, pregame skate,
depending who wants to be out there.
But either way, I mean, the Washington Capitals were down 2-0
to Columbus after games one and two in Washington last year,
and they went to frigging double overtime in game three.
So by no means are you panicking if you're Tampa.
It's a little wearisome to blow a three-goal lead for the first time
in 106 tries, and it happens to be the first game of the playoffs.
But I think that they approach the game the exact same way
they approach tonight when they play on Friday.
And another thing that might be getting lost in the shuffle here is that,
you know, Hedman is nursing something.
I don't know if it was a foot or ankle.
Did you guys know what he was nursing?
He missed the last four.
They termed it an upper body injury, but he did bang his head.
I think it was Haglund.
He whacked his face off somebody's helmet,
and then they think he might have got a mild concussion
or a slight concussion from that.
So when they say upper body.
So I was close.
It wasn't his ankle.
It was his head.
It was part of his body, Bissell.
Long way from the heart either way.
Shocker.
I'm fucking way off.
But all of a sudden, you throw that 30-minute defenseman back in the lineup.
It does shift the rhythm a little bit.
And those guys, they're a very skilled team,
and timing's a big part of their game.
So that might take a small adjustment,
but I imagine they get back to themselves in game two.
Because if not, boys, holy shit, pressure will be on in that locker room.
I mean, I know Cooper just got that extension, but Jesus Christ, man, like you can't go down in round one.
And we talked about how bad that matchup was for Tampa, though.
And shout out to my boy, Brad May.
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, the man who got a hole in one
and then forgot to put the ball in his bag
and hit it 700 yards out of bounds,
the next hole to lose the hole in one ball.
But he called.
He called the Columbus upset in round one I saw him on Twitter he was defending his take too so uh you
know that's obviously a nice start for for Mazie and with one thing that you actually asked me to
remind you of was the 50-50 in the first game in Boston um and you said it was for a charity and a
great cause I did not want to forget you to mention that.
Yeah, biz. Thank you very much for reminding me.
And before we go into your present interview, this is a really,
really sad thing to have to bring up, but it's a great cause.
And, and last summer three-year-old kid, Colin McGrath,
he was actually killed. He was in South Boston.
I don't know if you remember the story, RA,
he was in his stroller and got hit by a car.
Just a
Yeah.
Like, oh, it just gives me  just to talk about it just makes me shiver.
But I feel so bad for the family.
And they have an incredible thing going on.
It's  they started a project in honor of him.
And it's www.collinsjoyproject.org.
And game two of the Bruins game.
Uh,
Bruins Leafs is going to be the 50 50 is going to be,
be going to his charity.
And you can actually,
um,
be a part of this without being at the game or in Massachusetts,
I believe.
I think you can get online.
So,
um,
anyone to try to sign up and do that because it was a,
a horrible,
a sad story that I think that, um, they're trying to make the best out of it
with this project and what's going on there.
So it's a tough thing to talk about,
but I think everyone that could maybe look into it.
And we hope you enjoy the YIP interview.
And regarding all that information, we'll have Grinelli write a blog about it,
send it out on the Twitter and Instagrams of Spit and Chicklets
so you guys can either
swipe up or hit the link where you guys can enter the 50-50.
And you said you weren't sure, Whit, but R.A. said he was, that you can actually purchase
those tickets outside of Massachusetts.
So let's get as much money as we can for a great cause.
And we know our listeners are loyal and they'll help out.
Thank you.
All right.
Now let's send it over to Brandon Yip.
This was a very interesting interview. I had a lot of fun with him.
An absolute pleasure now
to be joined by a good friend of mine,
current member of the Kowloon Red
Star in the KHL over in
Shanghai. He fits
in very well. Former
Boston University National Champion
Terrier, played in the NHL.
Brandon Yip, thanks for joining the Spit and Chicklets podcast.
Hey, boys.
Thanks for having me.
This is an absolute pleasure.
So people who don't know, Yipper and I spend a lot of time this summer together out on the links.
And if I could describe his game, it's he goes from a.2 handicap who's hitting 320-yard drives on a string for 14 holes
to a 10 that sprays one and then snaps his driver over his knee.
Yeah, that's me, boys.
And then me and him sit there and go, fucking golf, fuck!
And we drive home just furious at the game.
But he probably always birdies the last hole,
and that's what brings him back every time.
Yeah, 100.
Dude, this year, it's a typical thing.
I think he had a bad stretch on the back nine,
and then everything was maxed out to the hog press on 18
and shoved one to a two-foot dart and birdie.
It took all the cash.
I'm like, yep, you fucking rat.
He's like, wait, how much did the round cost?
And then I think we had Old Sandwich the last time that happened,
and I rinsed you for like 500.
And we're walking back.
You know that rock that we hit to?
It's like 150 yards away.
You're like, okay, yep, we're like double or nothing.
If we hit this rock, you miss it.
Fucking bang right off the rock.
For people who haven't played Old Sandwich, it is exactly that.
You have the 18th hole.
So that's where a lot of bets are decided, right?
Of course.
Well, Old Sandwich also has a 19th hole.
They have a little 95-yard hole to a green, and then they actually have the same green
has a different tee box that's about a buck 20.
It's the 19th hole.
It's the settle your bets hole.
This kid, Bird, is 18.
He gets all this money already.
I'm like double or nothing on the 19th hole.
He beats me on that one.
Then if you drive down around the corner, there's a little mat, an actual driving range mat.
There's a rock 142 yards, maybe 138 yards on a string right in the middle of the pond or the back end of the pond.
Nobody's ever hit it with me.
I mean, there's wind.
It's a mat.
You don't know what club to hit.
And I'm down 500.
I'm like, fuck this.
Double nothing yet, bro.
And what do you know?
He drills the thing.
He's like, I hit the rock.
I hit the rock, folk.
I'm like, I was so mad at him.
But yeah, that was our last round, I think, last time.
We never invited him back.
Yeah, we got to get out there soon.
But I want to get into what's kind of going on for you right now.
And that's the last two years playing on a new team in the KHL in China.
For people who don't know and don't follow, you had a great year this year.
I think you were 10th in the vegan goals in the K.
Really?
Good for you, buddy.
Yeah, it only took me 10 years pro, but I managed to find the back of the net, so it was a good year, yeah.
So what's going on there? Because you're the captain.
Like I said, you fit in for people who aren't seeing you, but he's got a little Asian in him.
And he fits in perfect in China.
So how has it been to kind of be the leader of that team?
Dude, it's been an amazing experience.
Well, first of all, to tell you a little bit about it we're we're trying
to do kind of like what the nba did with basketball but for hockey so bring it over to this huge
market you know teach everyone the sport but it's not like basketball where it's kind of easy you
know like you take the ball you put in the hoop like hockey there's so many you know different
facets of the game and you know it's like hockey stick puck. Oh, yeah.
It's so much more confusing for people.
Why was there a whistle there?
Are the pucks still in play?
Yeah, to explain this to  it's not like when you go to Phoenix
where it was a new market when you were there.
People knew what hockey was.
Like in China, they don't even know what the fuck it is.
You're like, hockey stick, not chopstick, hockey stick,
you know, shit like that.
So it's really  it gets lost in translation.
But it's been a great time.
And the thing with basketball is they had Yao Ming
and Stefan Marbury, guys who had a ton of success in the NBA.
And unfortunately for hockey, there hasn't been a Chinese guy
that's done very well in the NHL.
You did pretty well, yeah.
No, luckily for me, I was the closest guy to it.
I think a big deal, too, with the NBA's worldwide popularity
is the Dream Team.
They went to the Olympics, and that's why I wanted to ask you,
how much does this hurt NHL worldwide recognition?
It's funny, I wrote down the Dream Team like you just mentioned, the NBA.
It seems like there's a huge untapped market.
There's a billion people just in China alone,
and the NHL's dropping the ball here.
Exactly.
They have done a little bit.
They had some exhibition games, if you guys have seen that, in Shanghai, right?
Bruins.
Yeah, the Bruins.
Well, the LA Kings are one team that's very involved over there.
They actually have a hockey development program.
We're going to get Derek Armstrong on the podcast to talk about it.
So they are one of the teams that have gone in there.
They're a very smart organization.
Their owner, Ann Schutz, who owns a company,
he's worth probably 20 billion.
So he's a pure business mind where he understands
that you need to get there first, and they are doing that.
So get back to your point.
So that's the whole thing.
They're trying to bring hockey there mainly because
they're hosting the Olympics in 2022.
And they want to be, you know, quote-unquote competitive in men's ice hockey.
They obviously get an automatic bid.
But the problem is, like, there's no Chinese hockey players.
I know.
You know?
But there's guys like myself that have played on, like, a lower level that are, you know, Chinese-Canadian or Chinese-American that we're bringing in to kind of coach up
and get ready for the Olympics.
Similar with what South created this year, right?
Yeah.
Except they had white guys on their team.
Yeah, you're actually Asian.
Yeah, so I'm like a fake.
The boys, my boy Brandon DeFazio,
I played with him the first year.
You guys had Mike Lata on the podcast.
Yeah, they did.
That's awesome.
Yeah, they're beauties.
And they would call us the Fasians, the fake Asians.
Wait, can you speak Asian?
No, but it's so Chinese.
It's Mandarin.
You don't, like, speak Asian.
Oh, my gosh.
Fuck you guys.
Yeah, can I get general gals?
Do you speak Mexican?
Do you speak Mexican?
So it's actually pretty funny.
You know how, like, you...
I'm trying to learn the language, you know,
because I'm going to be, like, the poster boy, right?
Well, think of how confused they are
when he walks up and he's, like, talking in English
and they're like, dude.
No, like, buddy, you're home.
Talk to us.
Hello.
No, they sniff me out, man.
They know I'm a fake.
They come up to me and they're like...
Canal Street.
Yeah, you're also, like, taller than everyone
for the poster boy.
Exactly, so you kind of stick out a little bit. I don't want to forget this thought because I never thought of this They come up to me and they're like... Canal Street. Yeah, you're also taller than everyone for the most part. Yeah, exactly.
So you kind of stick out a little bit.
I don't want to forget this thought because I never thought of this until you brought this up,
but what about you getting your passport to play in the Olympics?
Exactly.
So that's what they want to do with all the Fasians.
They want to get us our passports eventually
so we can help the team and play in the Olympics.
So it would be pretty cool.
That would be so sick.
You almost don't even want to think about it now
because you don't want to get your hopes up.
They're going to be paying for Krozy to get surgery on his eyes.
I'm hoping the NHL guys don't go there.
Get the old Trump direct deposit.
Is Artukin still around?
He's Asian looking.
Remember that animal?
But speaking of language, man, it's such a tough language to learn, dude.
It's insane. Just to give an example, it's such a tough language to learn, dude. It's insane.
Just to give an example, it's all about tones.
So ma, ma-a, ma, and ma mean four completely different things.
Get the fuck out of here.
So I'm just like fucking blown away.
Are you at the point where you're like, I don't think I'll learn?
Yeah, kind of.
I mean, I have to, but I've only taken like five one-on-one classes.
The lady's kind of like, this guy's a fucking idiot.
Yeah, like right away, they're like, this kid went to BU?
What?
Yeah, I can barely speak English, literally.
First of all, don't be too hard on yourself.
It has completely to do everything with the way your mind works and what side of the mind
you work, left or right.
Oh, is that the truth?
Yeah, because there's certain people who can memorize a textbook, but they can't have a
normal conversation.
Okay. I went to school with people who are highly intelligent where you're like man like where the
fuck is your common sense so don't be too hard on street smart yeah well you're good at something
take a good with the bad now and this is not an insult to char because now people are big oh what
you don't think you're street smart but he's a guy who can memorize languages. I believe he knows seven languages.
That's crazy. Is it Mandarin?
Is that the language? Yeah, Mandarin. VZ speech.
There's Cantonese too, but that's like more
South. Okay.
Shanghai. Shanghai. Dude, yeah.
Would I even, could I even
picture what I'd be seeing if I go there?
I don't even have a clue.
So think about this. There's nine million people
in New York City. Which is so monstrous.
There's 25 fucking million people in Shanghai.
That's a lot of fucking Chinese people.
Oh, my.
There's 1.5 billion in China.
1.5 billion.
Dude, it's insane.
How much of a horror nightmare is the subway?
It's fucking packed, but it's actually very clean and easy to get around.
It was actually pretty surprising yeah it was good but the first week i was there like
there's so many people there's people come there's like no you know when you grow up you're like okay
left right left like when you cross the road yeah there's nothing like that like it's 360 degree
head on a swivel like there's guys with fucking scooters going everywhere guys walking around and
you know the first week i'm like trying to dodge people,
but now I'm like tight in the car and just fucking bouncing off guys.
Like a 70-year-old lady, like grandma Chinese lady,
would not be afraid to just cold shoulder you and bury you
and just keep walking.
Doesn't faze them.
Russia has that aspect very much too.
Yeah, exactly.
And Russia's crowded too.
There's no lines ever in Russia.
So if you're going to like security at the airport,
it's just bully bully and
it feeds in and it ends up you know you go in but i i can kind of picture that is is like are there
just like survival accidents like everywhere on the road and stuff like are they bad yeah it's bad
man so yeah i mean typically we're not the greatest drivers yeah i know but you understand when you're
there because it's kind of like driving like you just you just go and if someone
gets in the way like you either hit them or they're gonna fucking stop you don't get anywhere
being nice yeah exactly boston yeah exactly so you gotta just fucking go i have so many other
questions what about fan wise how are you guys doing is it kind of a struggle or like i mean
because you guys are good right well i kind of want to hear him just give his overall assessment
of what china's like yeah it's true well, we can get into that, too.
A funny story.
I actually bring up my wife for a second.
She'll enjoy this.
She's like, if you go on chicklets, there's only two things.
You better fucking mention me, and you better tell Whit to not talk about any partying,
because else I'll fucking kill him.
Okay, so let's hear the party stories.
You know Liz.
Sorry, Liz.
You know Liz.
Hey, sleep.
We can all go out
and party soon
so this was a good story
about how crowded it is
so it was New Year's Eve
and we're going to
meet the boys
and everyone else
for dinner
and
there was just
millions of people
on the street
like we're in the main drag
and there's fucking
just people everywhere
like you can barely walk
and to describe it
like we're eating up top
at one of
the high rises no big deal and uh you look down it looked just like a bunch of fucking ants on like
an anthill man going in every direction yeah humans though so we go back down to street level
and we got across the street and i'm with him we're fucking late obviously and i'm bouncing
off people whatever i cross the street i turn back and you
see this fucking she's like wearing six inch heels it's near as you blonde hair down her ass just
fucking liz yeah you know liz like she she's like you like if you get in a personal space like she
has no time for that so she's like oh boy fucking these chinese people all the way like ah now i'm
sitting there like it's blondzillaondzilla! Blondzilla!
That's a picture of how many people are there.
How many head turns would she get walking down the street? Oh, dude, they'd just stare at you, man.
They'd stare at me, they'd stare at her.
Blonde hair, some American chick.
Did anyone ever offer her money or anything?
Probably.
And I'm like, well, how much?
They're like paparazzi.
They're just like, this person has to be somebody.
Why are they here?
Yeah, she got that a lot in Germany, too.
They always think she's some celebrity, you know?
Is it clean?
You know what?
Shanghai, dude, like going over there, I was so worried because, you know, you go to like Chinatown and everyone's local Chinatown.
It's very congested.
It can be dirty.
You know, it's very crowded.
But you get to Shanghai, man, it's like living in the future. It's so clean. It's very congested. It can be dirty. You know, it's very crowded, but you get to Shanghai, man.
It's like living in the future.
It's so clean.
It's very spread out.
It's very westernized.
Like, a lot of people speak English.
You get all the nice restaurants and hotels,
all the Americanized ones.
And so there wasn't much of, like,
a culture shock for us.
And it's funny because you right away,
when you went over there,
I remember we were golfing.
And you're like, dude, like, I have this deal in China, but I'm like, I don't know.
This is like a panic.
It's a first-year KHL team.
How easily could that go down?
And I remember being like, dude, you could be like a monster superstar endorser over there.
Are you on billboards there?
Yeah, you could be on billboards.
But quickly, I was also now thinking with what you're saying,
it's probably one of the best places to play in the KHL.
People love Helsinki, but now China, this is an incredible city.
Dude, it's amazing.
We're going to actually move to Beijing next year.
Oh, really?
But our whole attitude is like we struggled.
We didn't make the playoffs the last two years,
but now we're going to try and kind of form it into a North Americanized team
because we can have unlimited imports. If you're in Russiaussia where you play you played in sochi only have four
i believe yeah five five now and um you could be the only north american on your team though so
you could have no one to like hang out with during the day and blah blah blah but for our team
we have like you know 15 north american guys and the Fasians like myself, we're North American too. So it's like you're having a North American team in the KHL.
Kind of like Zagreb's still like that, right?
Yeah, but they folded a couple years ago.
Oh, I didn't know that.
But yeah, very similar.
So you're going around these crazy Russian cities and all that, and it's a blast because you're with all your buddies.
Tim Brent played in the KHL.
I believe they might have been in Croatia.
He was in Magnitogorsk too, I remember.
He was kind of a... Where did they win?
He played on a team at one point, I believe, over there
that it was similar, where they had all North
Americans. They might have went to the finals one year
or it may have been... Maybe Prague?
Prague. Was it Prague? That's where it was similar,
where they didn't have an import rule
or maybe they were allowed more imports.
I'm going to check right now. Yeah, check that.
They just all gelled and played together,
where, of course, you go to Russia, you get a little mix of imports,
and the Russians, they can't even speak to each other.
Yeah, exactly.
Team chemistry.
Yeah, exactly.
And I remember seeing it.
And you get lonely, man.
You probably went through it.
Well, I was lucky because Corey Emerton was a guy from over here.
I lived right next door to him.
And we had a Swede, Andre Petersen, great guy, and a Finn.
But you could be an American or a Canadian, go over there,
and actually have imports that you'd never even really hang out with.
And then you're fucked because you just don't hang out with the Russians.
And then you're in some shit city.
I actually played with one of my old teammates.
Who's that?
Kyle Cipchera.
He was in Magnitogorsk.
Beauty.
Which is like a whatever.
What?
Can you talk, Biz, or no?
I was just looking.
I mean, like, you've never done that to me, Biz?
Are you kidding me right now?
No, whatever.
Yeah.
I don't know.
What were you guys saying?
Yeah, Chipper.
You're talking about Chipper.
Is Kunlun a city?
Is that a sponsor?
Is that how you say it?
K-U-N-L-U-N?
Kunlun, yeah.
That's, I think, the region.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, but I don't really know what it means.
To be honest, I should find that out.
Now, is it the region?
Kunlun Red Star.
Have they embraced the team?
Yeah, so the problem is we have been in Shanghai the last two years,
and we were originally supposed to be in Beijing.
So they haven't dumped a lot of money
into marketing and bringing and bringing fans to the game which has been a problem but now that
we're moving to beijing where all our sponsors are and where the olympics is going to be i think
we're going to attract a lot more fans um going back to the time you spent in the nhl so i was
actually i don't know if it was your first goal but you came down just sniped one in in colorado i was on anaheim i'm like holy fuck yipper but what what
was that experience like because you had a nice little run in colorado it was you obie who else
was the crew a bunch of the o'reilly o'reilly would factor we had chris stewart with shatty
yeah that was a good team with young players yeah we were uh we started off really hot um
i remember that story because you told me in the summer when we were at golf and i remember my goal
obviously it was actually my first goal in the nhl so that's what i was wondering and i think i
i dumped the puck in like hit the d-man the d-man got it through to the winger i skated fast he'd
hit the winger they brought out of the zone i curled up and then um they hit me on a regroup
and i passed i think scott Scott Niedermeyer,
who retired that year probably because I passed him.
And I went down and sniped on Hiller.
And I remember you telling me when we were golfing,
you went back after the first period,
and Getzloff came up in the room.
He was like, who the fuck is this Chinese guy
flying around out there?
And you just started dying laughing.
You're like, it's my boy, Yip.
He's pulling on his hair.
I don't want to say his deathly gets.
I don't remember, but somebody in the room goes,
who the fuck is this Chinese guy flying around the ice?
Like, oh, man, he played at BU last year.
They won the national championship.
Well, should we talk about BU?
Yeah, man, we missed each other.
We missed each other by, I think, a couple years, actually.
Yeah, maybe a couple years.
But your team, who are the NHLers on you?
We had a lot of guys.
Dude, we had, like, when we won my senior year,
I think we had, like, 10 to 12 guys playing the NHL the next year or two after that.
Like, our decor was ridiculous.
We had, you know, Matt Gilroy, Brian Strait, Kevin Sheinkirk, Eric Greiba,
Dave Worsofsky,
Colby Cohen,
who was a stud in college.
That was your six or seven?
That was our six.
He didn't even name
the forwards.
They had Colin Wilson,
Nick Bonino,
Chris Higgins,
who played in Vancouver.
No, no,
a different Chris Higgins.
This Chris Higgins
is the Datsuki
in Belsuit.
The Belfast Datsuk?
Yeah.
No, but he was like one of those guys that are just fucking nasty in college, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Him and Jason Lawrence was on the team.
But we had Benino, you know, myself, Johnny Mack, guys who made the NHL.
So the team was a wagon.
It was a wagon of a team.
You got from British Columbia.
You grew up, right?
Yeah.
How'd you end up at BU?
Yeah, no, I just ended up there.
I had a bunch of offers and actually went to St. Cloud first.
And I didn't know what college was coming from Canada.
And I went to St. Cloud to visit because they were the first team that, like, showed interest in me.
So I was kind of being, like, loyal to them.
So I went there for the weekend, came back, and I was, like, had the best time.
Like, they showed me around, you know.
And I was like, Dad, like dad yeah like i'm going to
saint cloud that place was fucking amazing oh my god he's like whoa whoa whoa whoa like you should
really check out another school i'm like all right i'll go one more visit and he's like okay go to
boston go to bu and i went there and met all the boys and they all took i think i probably would
have met you i don't know they all the boys took me out and i came back and i was like all right
yeah i'm going to be you and then like some other school was like, we just got to get him here for a visit.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I went to St. Cloud, and there was this guy named Bugsy pouring my drinks.
I don't even remember the rest of the night.
I woke up next to three chicks like it was he got game when he ended up sleeping with the two blondes with the huge boobs.
Sorry, Liz.
But, yeah, no, so that, wow, so Switzeruski.
So, all right, well, then you give me, like, the breakdown on how you decided,
all right, I'm kind of over here.
I'm done over here trying to make the NHL.
I'm going to Europe.
What summer was that?
Yeah, that's the  you guys didn't really go through that
because you guys played in the NHL a long time,
but that's a tough decision, man.
It's really tough.
And I made it probably a year too late.
But going back on it, looking back, you always want to get back to the NHL.
I was like, I can't give up.
It's my dream.
And I was there.
I know I can get back.
Yeah, right.
And you know if you play there, you're not going to be out of place.
You just need that opportunity, blah, blah, blah.
But as you guys know, the league, it's a lot younger and the new crops coming each year so
finally I think uh I was getting like healthy scratch in the a and all that so I got some
offers over in uh in Europe and I decided to go to Germany which was awesome because I kind of
fell in love with the game again you know it's tough getting called up and down and getting
healthy scratch and blah blah blah you blah. You might get traded.
You go over there, and you're on the team.
And we ended up winning a championship there.
So it really made me fall in love with the game again, and it was awesome.
And who was the player?
Was it Metropolitan?
Yeah, Glenn Metropolitan. Yeah, this guy.
You and him were boys, right?
Yeah, we were boys.
When the guest's face light up when you say it.
Yeah, when you say it.
So give us a story.
I don't know. That's tough. So give us a story. Oof.
I don't know.
That's tough.
So then the filter comes out and you're like,
sure,
you're going to tell
the 10 best ones
and we get the 11th best.
Yeah,
but no,
he's awesome
and he's always ready to go.
Yeah,
he has a scrappy
backstory too,
man.
Not a lot of people
gave him a chance.
He grew up on the projects
in Toronto
and had a tough upbringing
and he really came true.
He's a Bruin, right?
Yeah.
He played roller hockey until he was 14 and then decided to play ice hockey.
He went all the way through the ranks, East Coast,
like these crazy leagues you don't even know.
And then he plays fucking like 500 games in the NHL.
And he plays until he's like 42.
It's like Beagle for Vancouver now.
Apparently he won a championship in the coast
he ended up getting called up played in the american league and hershey ended up winning a
calder cup last year yeah and then last year when he won the stanley cup he was he was the first guy
to everyone ever win the championship in all three leagues and like people just love those come-up
stories because you know nowadays you get drafted in the you know first two three rounds like you're gonna keep getting opportunity after opportunity just based on your your the fact
that you were drafted high yeah like think i mean think even back then if you were a first rounder
you would you would get like a like gilbert brulee who you play with there's another example
like he would bounce around from team to team yeah you're gonna get you get extra lives yeah
you get extra lives you're like a cat you lives. You're like a cat. You get nine of them.
And he's actually doing really well in the KHL.
Bruce Layton.
Yes, he is.
Where was he this year?
He's making bank.
Yeah.
He ended up signing Layton in Novosibirsk.
You know what? You've been there.
He's like a Nigel Dawes.
He's like a Nigel Dawes where he's found his game.
He lights that league up.
He lights it up, but he couldn't be a full-time player for the Rangers, and now he's going
over there.
He's a superstar in that league, much like Gilbert Brule.
There was a little bit of a tough patch here.
I think he was considering quitting hockey.
Here's a story.
When I was playing with him in Phoenix when he was there,
Dom Maloney wanted him.
He thought he could be finally the GM to crack the code,
and he had him as a full-time guy.
Dave Tippett wasn't crazy about his 200-foot game,
so he was just there practicing mostly.
He'd get thrown in the lineup, but like in a fourth-line role.
So they were trying to send him down.
He just wasn't answering his phone.
So Jim O'Neill, the team security guy, headed over to his hotel,
and he was sitting by the pool.
And they're like, hey, man, we've been trying to reach you.
You have a flight leaving out of here.
You're going down to the minors.
He's like, yeah, no, just tell them I'm not going.
I quit.
Really?
Yeah, so Jim O'Neill had to call Don Maloney and Tip
and be like, yeah, he's by the pool.
He's just enjoying the sun, and he just said he's done.
I played with Brew in Edmonton.
There was times he was nasty.
He was nasty.
And in the WHL, he was a freak, too.
He was stud.
He went top five overall, didn't he?
I think he was sixth.
I think he was sixth, if I remember right.
Also, a crazy story about him.
There's an article written about it. He's a crazy Story about him There's like an article
Written about it
He's a huge music guy
He's like really into music
I think he loves U2
Well he was driving along
One time
And he saw these two people
Stuck in the pouring rain
I think it's Stanley Park
In Vancouver
It was pouring
And he picked them up
Turns out it was
Bono from U2
Yeah he told that story
I think Bono
And somebody else
So it's a pretty crazy story They ended up like talking He wore a Brulee jersey On the stage For from U2 Yeah, he told that story I think Bono and somebody else So it's a pretty crazy story
They ended up talking
He wore a Brulee jersey on the stage
For a U2 concert
But what else?
Okay, in the middle of the conversation
You reminded me of something
You said he's making bank over there
So you had a huge year
Are there no Russian teams
Looking to pay you some bank?
You get 20 in that league
You got teams calling
Yeah, exactly
There's a few teams interested for sure, yeah.
Is the Russian gas available for a China-based KCL team?
The Russian gas, yeah.
Have you heard about what I say?
Have you heard about guys in the league with the IV before the game?
Yeah, but I can't like, I'm still playing in the league.
I know, but what I said is it happens in the league, so I feel't really comment on everything like that. It happens in the league, so I feel like everyone knows.
Did you ever catch wind about us, or more so Wit, getting heat by the media from the KHL?
Really?
Yeah, there were news outlets covering the fact that he was trashing on the country.
No, it was about me saying that the women were tender ones.
Oh, yeah, I did see something like that.
I did see something like that.
I said there were 10s or 1s, which is a fact.
So what, did the mediocre women complain?
Yeah, you have like Katarina, the 11.3, or Olga, the 0.6.
I mean, what are you going to do?
That's the country.
I think it's not really an insult.
It is what it is.
We're talking about the Russian guests.
You can't really comment on that. Yeah. You can't really comment on that.
Yeah, I can't really comment on that.
So you're not signing with anyone for next year yet?
No, but I'm obviously in negotiations with Kuhnlin,
and obviously that's going to probably be my spot.
Coach North American?
Yeah, we just got a new coach in.
Kurt Fraser is in the NHL for several years.
He's out in Dallas.
And Steve Kasper and, let's see, Kovalev.
Kovy.
Whoa, Steve Kasper. Kovalev. Kovy. Whoa, Steve Kasper.
Kovalev.
Dude, Kovy still has it.
Like, when you know when the Healthy Scratches play, like, three on three after practice,
Bizzy know about it.
So do I.
Don't worry.
And so he's still, like, fucking nasty.
Like, he goes around there and just dangling guys, like, going top titty.
So he's still sick.
He can still play.
Oh, easily, dude.
Stevie Casper.
He was known as the Wayne Gretzky shutdown guy.
Every time when they played him, the Bruins played him, they put Casper on Gretzky.
He would shut him down.
Then they finally traded for him.
Shutting him down was like getting two and one instead of three and three.
But then he got, well, I mean, he's a coach again.
But he got ran out of town, basically.
He actually started.
Bench Ray Bork, right?
No, it was Neal Ian Stevens, and he put him in the lineup,
and then he stapled him to the bench all game.
He just sat them there all game, which, like, first off,
it's insulting to these veterans, and then second off,
you're handicapping your team by fucking shooting your bench by two guys.
It was just like ass-nodding, and then that was it.
He was done-zo after that.
He hasn't coached again since.
There's a funny story about Casper.
You know you do the drills where the coach passes you the puck,
and he was struggling this one drill, and Lats comes up to me.
He's like, I see why he won the selkie.
Lats is funny.
What was he like over there?
Michael Latta.
Michael Latta is the individual we're talking about.
We call him Lats.
He was on the podcast.
Yeah, one of my good buddies over there.
Yeah, he was a beauty. You can't really be a tough guy there though because you
get one fight and you get suspended the next time you know yeah it's funny for russia because it's
such a fucking crazy place yeah i think they stopped the fighting when that like those crazy
like chris simon and all those guys went over and just beat the fucking wheels off everyone
it was always so nobody wanted to play.
It's going to drive me nuts, the team.
I don't remember the team right now off the top of my head, but we dealt with them.
Yeah.
Well, you played against them. It wasn't like that then.
It had already kind of changed, but they had a couple years.
You're right.
There's a YouTube clip of Jeremy Oblonsky and Nasty Marasty.
They played over there, too?
They played on that team together, and they actually got in an off-ice brawl.
You can go watch it on YouTube.
I think some people were at a wedding,
and they were at a bar next door to the hall or something,
and there was an argument that ensued,
and then all of a sudden you see Jablonski and Morasty
just throwing with all these Russian KGB bosses.
I think it was VTS, that team.
VTS, yeah.
It's just outside of Moscow,
so they probably ran
to moscow a few times how bad is the travel though the travel is fucking brutal man like
there's no going around it i don't mind it because watch shows yeah but i i can't like a little bit
i can't watch shows i have like 280d for that but i play cards and like we do the same thing we're
doing now we shoot the shit so it's not too bad this one flight well so when we go to moscow to to shanghai you got to stop in nova siberia it's
like halfway to refuel so this one trip we just went on a heater like we we won so everyone's in
good mood you know having beers wine on the plane whatever we're two hours outside of moscow the
plane starts turning around i'm like what everyone's like yeah but what the fuck's going on
i'm like i don't know i go up to the gm like what's going on why the fuck are starts turning around. I'm like, what? Everyone's like, yeah, but what the fuck's going on? I'm like, I don't know. I go up to the
GM. I'm like, what's going on? Why the fuck are we turning around?
He's like, the stewardess forgot to
go through customs in Moscow
because she thought we were going through them in
Novosibirsk. So we had to turn
around, go back another two hours
for this fucking stewie to
go through customs.
Yeah, so this 10-hour trip just turned
into a 14-hour trip.
Probably 15.
So the boys were...
Well, no, that would be 16.
I'm not a math guy, but just hear me out.
So you drove two, and you had to go back two,
and then retrace the two.
Yeah, despite being Asian, I'm not very good at math.
Math's not my strong suit.
What's the longest flight you have going from one city to another there?
That's probably the longest one, or that one to Slovan, which is in Czech. But the thing longest flight you have going from one city to another there? That's probably the longest one or that one to Slovan
which is in Czech.
But the thing is like you'll fly. It's not like
you're going there and back. Like we go to Moscow
and we'll stick around for like
10 days to two weeks and like play all the
teams around there. Yeah, exactly.
And then you get long homestands. So we're
sometimes we're in Shanghai for like a month
and don't move. So that's
when it gets good. How are the Stewies?
The Stewies are pretty decent.
Keith Gantle calls them fart sniffers.
Because on the plane, you're like...
Just drop it.
Bomb.
Especially you guys are boozing, probably getting your beers in.
And they're having Chinese food from Kunlun.
Yeah, exactly.
And they're just farting and farting.
And then they come up and they're like,
Hey, you guys want anything else?
And they're kneeling down beside you.
And you're like, oh, these girls are
so nice. And I just dropped a bomb
and I know she smells it, but she's
keeping that smile on her face. Yeah, real professional.
Real professional. When you guys
played like Ska and Seska, did they
just trounce you? Oh my god, yeah.
They're so sick. They're nasty.
Like that Ska team, St. Petersburg,
they had like last year, they had Datsuk,
Kovalchuk, they have like Gusev. They have guys like... That Gusev is filthy. Yeah, nasty. There's guys, TM, St. Petersburg. Last year they had Datsuk, Kovalchuk, they have Gusev.
They have guys like nasty.
There's guys that, there's like 10 Russian names I have never even heard of,
but they're like disgusting at hockey.
And they would never even consider coming over to the NHL.
They just want to make bank in Russia and drink their vodka.
They're making bank.
They're absolute legends in their hometown.
Who do you think, is there one person that this year in the KHL, like, impressed you the most?
Yeah, that Gusov is.
I know.
How is he never, like, I thought he was going to be Panarin-ish.
Yeah, how old is he?
I don't think he's very old.
There's another guy on CSCO that's really good.
Yeah, Akaprasov.
Yeah, he's nasty.
He's the wild guy.
He's got to come over soon, I think.
Yeah, we talked about that recently.
Apparently, he's got, like, two more years over there, like his contract.
Oh, really?
The Wilds are like, oh.
And that's the whole thing with Kovalchuk.
I don't know if this was a rumor, but this is what I heard.
The reason why he left all that money on the table with New Jersey, that 100 million contract,
is because he went to Russia and made that money in five years, and now he's fucking
back in the NHL.
Make any sign for 18.
He didn't get taxed on it either.
Yeah, exactly. I want to ask, how's the grub? fucking back in the nhl yeah like any time for 18 didn't get taxed on it either yeah exactly so
i want to ask how's the grub i know people in america think chinese food is how chinese food
tastes in china but that's not really the case is the food really good over there is it yeah it's
awesome and you can get everything man it's so westernized like you'd have no idea like you if
you went there and didn't eat you wouldn't you didn't have to eat chinese food but yeah i mean
there's there's some fucking weird food out there but but the real kind of like the high-end Chinese food there,
it's awesome.
It never tastes anything better,
but you go around to like,
there's this place called the Yu Garden,
and it's like a tour spot,
and they serve like live squid on sticks
and like scorpions and shit,
and you're like, what the fuck?
And I'm like all for trying everything once,
but I can't even hold
a dead scorpion
because I'm scared of it still,
but I'm not going to eat it.
Maybe if you de-shell it.
Maybe just fry that thing
for five minutes.
What's the weirdest thing you ate?
What was it?
I think I had like
cow testicles or some shit,
but I didn't even know
I was eating it.
They told me after.
They told you after?
I was like, ah, it wasn't too bad.
You were in the Wonton Don over there, right?
Donnie does?
Oh, yeah.
Donnie does.
Yeah, we're over there.
We go for beers every now and then.
He's a great dude.
He has some great content.
You guys watch his videos.
He's probably one of the best at barstool at creating content.
He's a genius.
I think recently he was in Afghanistan or something.
Really?
He's nuts.
Yeah, he came out on the road with us one time and did a skit for us.
It was pretty good.
Yeah, and I think it was against CSKA.
And I believe the next year you beat him and he wasn't there or something.
Yeah, exactly.
We beat him this year, which was huge.
That was right before that trip I told you about.
You played with Wojtek Wolski.
Yeah, Wolski was there.
And he broke his neck a few years ago playing in the KHL.
He ended up having a miraculous comeback,
and he's back to the top of his game.
Yeah, exactly.
What a scary story that was.
You guys should actually have Mon.
He has some pretty fun Russian stories for you.
But, yeah, he broke his neck down there.
That's not really the place you want to break your neck.
And he was telling me every procedure they did, they did wrong.
You know what I mean?
Oh, Christ.
But he made a full recovery, so he's good.
Holy shit.
What about, I know we've taken up your time here.
Any, like, stories that come into your head of Parker, Jack Parker,
it be you snapping on you?
Jackie Parker, no.
Because David Quinn, the Rangers coach now is your assistant
coach when you guys want it all. Yeah exactly
no Parker his typical
thing for me would be a 20 mile bike
Sunday morning just be brutal
just puking
up Saturday night. Do you know the story
Neddy Havern was originally
the guy who told me he's another Boston guy
about when the kid had the jammer
and then he still made it on time for the meeting.
And you don't know what I'm talking about?
He had a heart attack?
Oh, yeah.
That's like, honestly, that story would have to be told by Ned or somebody else.
It's like a three-minute story that we couldn't even get into right now.
But that's BC.
That was legendary.
Yeah, BC.
He lost an eagle.
But yeah, I don't know the story well yeah. I don't know the story well enough.
I don't know the story well enough.
I don't really have to tell that one.
Well, dude, man, I thank you so much for coming on.
I don't know if there was anything else you wanted to chat about.
Do the boys listen over there?
Oh, yeah.
Everyone listens.
I love it.
I love it.
That's cool.
Let's see what else you got written down.
What else?
A laptop.
Well, I wanted to talk a little bit about our owner.
So Billy Nagak's he's uh
he's the best guy in the world multi-billionaire like multi like over 10 i guess i've heard
so it's funny i always introduce some of the people i'm like the billy goat yeah i'm like
hey this is billy short for billionaire so um no he's the best and um he would uh he so this is how rich he is like i'm gonna tell you
two stories of how rich this guy is because he always has an entourage around him and the last
couple years i'm kind of his golden boy so we've been become pretty tight and uh he came in this
year to shanghai and he's like yeah bro let's go you know let's go for uh dinner or something or
drinks or whatever so i met him for drinks and we're losing at the time so he wanted to know what was going on with the team
anyways he comes there and this time it's one-on-one and but there's this guy kind of behind
him and he doesn't introduce him so i'm kind of like weirded out like who the hell is this guy
whatever we sit down we're sitting across from each other this guy's like sitting like a little
bit behind him and uh billy takes a sip of his wine and like he gets like a little bit behind him. And Billy takes a sip of his wine and he gets a little dribble on his chin.
And this guy reaches over with a napkin
and starts patting his lips.
I'm like, oh my God, he has a fucking personal butler.
I'm like, holy shit.
And before the meal, the butler takes out his pills
and starts feeding him his pills, gives him his water.
Billy's sitting there with his hands down like that.
As he's getting fed.
I'm like, oh my god. I'm not used to hanging out with people like that.
I'm used to hanging out with
pigeon millionaires like you two, not like
billionaires.
I need somebody to wipe my face when I get some food on me.
And meanwhile, Yipper's like, this guy's going to put a bullet
in my head if I don't answer the right questions as to why
we're on a losing streak.
You're never going to hear from me again.
I'm thinking now I should negotiate that into my next contract.
Take 100,000 off, give me a butler.
When the bill comes, do you even bother
trying to reach in?
Give them the courtesy.
Actually, the Chinese culture,
they'll fight over bills. That's the culture.
Oh, fuck.
You guys looking for a stay-at-home
defenseman? Literally stay at my house and there, getting sucked off by a geisha?
And the other story about Billy and how fucking rich he is, he has...
So I met one of his pilots this year.
I was over in Sweden.
And he was telling me he's got, like, two huge...
He's got one private jet that's, like, a 200-seater.
He's got a 20-seater jet that he uses regularly.
200-seater.
Yeah, like something stupid.
So he owns like his own 747.
Yeah, exactly.
Like I don't know planes, but yeah, 747.
And then he's got like some crazy 300-foot yacht in the south of France, blah, blah, blah,
which I better be going on soon.
Billy.
So he tells me he's like, and he smokes cigarettes while he's flying so he's on his
jet and every two months he gets his whole carpet changed and all the um upholstery because he spits
on the floor so how much does that cost to like change every two months that you know you're
living when you're doing shit like that get a spittoon yeah yeah exactly that's but that's when
you know you're like hey next time yipper goes back and
flies i was playing with him that same guy is just eating his spit he's instead of on the floor
his mouth wiper guy but no this guy's like hey yeah hey biz he's gonna call you after and be
like hey i'm trying to recarpet my apartment in scottsdale you want to maybe just uh give me his
number i'll take that stuff he's ripping up from the plane. He's actually very humble besides having a personal butler and all that,
but he's the nicest guy.
Does he know anything about hockey?
Not really, but he's learning.
But one funny story about how positive this guy is,
and he's always giving us double bonuses and triple bonuses.
He'll come in there and be like,
yep, a double bonus, and start clapping his hand.
And the boys are like, yeah!
So anyways, we played that St. Petersburg team,
and Keenan was our coach the first year.
So we just got pumped 7-1.
I think I had the only goal.
Thank you.
I had my guy.
I did my job.
Where's my bonus?
Where's my spit guy?
So we're like, oh, fuck. Billy's at the game.
Keenan's going to come in and rip us.
And after you lose a big one like that, you're trying to hide.
And Billy comes in the room, and he's like, yippa.
I'm like, what?
He's like, why no music?
Why not be happy?
Be fun.
I believe in you guys.
It's OK.
Be happy.
And he starts clapping, and everyone's like, what the fuck?
I look over at Keenan.
There's just steam coming out of his ears he just wants to fucking rip someone that's just a story of how
like positive this guy is and he really wants to make this happen this is my dream coach any keen
stories keen dog he's actually um still a part of the organization so i can't go too hard at him
but you told me you really liked him you guys got got along, you said. Yeah, he got along. I got along with him.
You play hard.
He likes your...
You're going to fight and you're going to like...
And he respected me.
Like, he obviously fucking...
Sorry, gave it to some guys and like really bad.
One funny story about Keenan.
So there's this guy on our team, Zach Ewan.
He's another Fajan.
He came from Vancouver and he played in the East Coast, right?
So he's coming from the East Coast to the KHL. uh we had this meeting we lost like 10 in a row and
keenan's going around ripping guys like yeah bro what the fuck are you doing out there like you
were supposed to be a leader like what the fuck and you know you just take it from guys like that
you're just like okay like you don't talk back all of a sudden he starts giving to Zach and Zach just fucking fires back. And we're all like, ooh.
We're like, Zach.
I'm like, stop, stop, stop, stop.
So they go at it back and forth, blah, blah, blah.
We go to the airport and we're in line at customs and he's like,
Yipper, come here.
I'm like, oh, fuck.
He's like, of all my years playing hockey,
I've had two fucking guys talk back to me like that.
Brett Hall, but now Zach fucking Ewan.
You know, the other guy's a Hall of Famer.
You thought he was going to like it?
Yeah, I know what you mean by that.
So Keenan challenges guys, and he has a lot of respect for guys.
There are certain coaches like that, or a lot of them,
that maybe you might have had a bad game, but if they they come at you and challenge them and then you go back at
them they like that because now especially if you you say fuck you put me on there and i'm going to
deliver now and shove it up your ass there's a time and a place right yeah yeah hitchcock's very
similar he doesn't care he's doing it to get you going some coaches do take it over the line Keenan's like that for sure Keenan's like that and and uh Adrian Acquaint said the same
thing like he said a couple times you know he went back and and did he not tell the story about
McGilney going back at him like buddy you haven't seen shit like oh I agree with it's like McGilney
and Brett Hall that's what I'm saying right not like yeah of course it's my boy so but it's not
like Zach Ewan you know pretty good for zach
you're gonna be able to say him and brett hall have something in common exactly it's a great
story i i love that i forgot how did billy make all his money family money or did he yeah he he
made all his money in energy so i guess he owns like one of the biggest energy companies in uh
in china all natural caffeine inhaler how about the picture this year of you in that fight?
Maybe the best picture I've ever seen when you're wound up.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you connecting with the guy's face or are you just wound up for a while?
We've got to get this out and check until we drop this.
I don't know if I connected or not, but the guy, I think that fight was last year
and the guy just quit.
He just fell down, so I was like, whatever.
And what about the other clip I saw this year of the fight
when did the guy not swing a stick at you? you see that that was crazy it was six on five
as an empty net and i scored the empty net goal and this guy was just he was just pissed off i
guess like i didn't know it at the time but he just threw a stick out of frustration was it keith
yandel and very similar though so i just it was perfect timing like i turned the same way where
he threw a stick and all i see is this fucking stick coming at me.
So I duck and then instantly chuck my stick back in that direction.
Unfortunately, I missed him, and I hit Taylor back in the chest,
but then just an insta-scrap.
That's for the Gordie Howe, too, so I'll take it.
Exactly.
Love it.
What else you got written down on that laptop?
Yeah, what do I got for the boys?
I didn't want to leave anything out.
Hey, how about when your masseuse got hit in the eye like that before?
Oh, my God, Sammy.
Fuck, I felt so bad for him.
Just took one right off my neck.
So let's hear the story.
Yeah, no, he just...
Well, I'm just looking at this picture.
Yeah, it's just a picture, yeah.
The worst black eye of all time.
Buried him, yeah.
Oh, shit.
It's crazy how diverse our team is.
Because you can't... it's hard to find
um Chinese hockey players like bottom line so last year they did a good job of just looking
for all these guys and we had guys like Luke Lockhart who played at UBC who just graduated and
we found this other guy um Brayden Jha who played four years at Harvard so you know when you go to
camp and you're introducing yourself to everyone
and you're always like, hey, how was your season last year?
Where did you play last year?
So I go to Jhazy and I'm like, yeah, Jhazy, where did you play last year?
How did it go?
He's like, I was an investment banker.
So he was an investment banker for a year and now came back to playing the KHL.
Like how crazy is that?
You're like, oh, fuck, man.
We're going to be terrible this year.
Give them credit, man.
They play on our fourth line and they buzz around
and they do a great job and they give the boys
a lot of energy.
They've been doing really well.
That's awesome.
Are they building any rinks or anything in China?
In order to get Chinese players, you need to get some grassroots going.
That's a good question.
When the Chinese people want to get something done, they fucking do it.
So they want to bring hockey to China.
And they just built 150 rinks over this past year.
150.
They now have it part of the curriculum for kids in grade 1 through 7 to play hockey in school.
No way.
Yeah. So they're just going to try and take over.
Oh, yeah.
It's all government-backed.
They want hockey to be like basketball or soccer,
like when you bring these Westernized sports in.
So it's even too early, though.
It hasn't been long enough.
There's possibly some 13, 14-year-olds that are making noise somewhat.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah.
For sure, I think there is.
The problem with  it's not popular over there.
So you see like the actual Chinese national team
that the guys who have been playing in China,
born and raised, and they're really fast.
They got a lot of skill,
but the team game lacks a little bit.
So they need guys like some North American guys
that know the game that can kind of help them
and teach them strategy and positioning and all that.
Have you been to that?
You just mentioned gambling.
Is it Macau?
Macau?
Where is that?
It's right off of Hong Kong.
I actually went to Hong Kong, but I didn't go to Macau, but I'll be going there for sure
soon.
I heard it's just fucking Vegas times 20.
It's insane, apparently.
I didn't know if you'd done that one yet.
Oh, you know what's fun over there?
Have you heard of the fake markets?
Yeah, like Canal Street? Yeah. one yet oh you know what no it's fun over there have you heard of the fake markets yeah like canal
street yeah like so no no like there's these fake markets in in um like you know right yeah there's
these fake markets in shanghai it's very famous so tourists get attracted these spots and it's
it's like an underground like um it looks like a train station with all these kiosks and there's
just people trying to sell you like it's all fake shit so like fake gucci shoes right yeah it looks like a train station with all these kiosks, and there's just people trying to sell you, like, it's all fake shit, so, like, fake Gucci shoes.
Right, yeah, it's like Canal City.
Oh, that's what it is.
Okay, yeah, it's like that, but times a million.
And they're pretty close to the knockoff.
They're spot on, like, you can't tell,
but they have everything.
They have, like, Beats headphones or, like, anything.
I don't know why, guys.
Just something's different.
Yeah, like, it's fake, but, like, a Louis Vuitton belt,
like, the one I'm wearing right now.
That looks legit. Yeah, I mean, it's legit, but a Louis Vuitton belt, the one I'm wearing right now. That looks legit.
Yeah, I mean, it's legit, but you can get a fake one and you wouldn't be able to tell, right?
But guys buy Beats headphones that are fake.
Why the fuck are you buying those?
It's going to break in the audio.
The quality sucks, so I don't get that.
If it's something that you're wearing, that'll be fine.
It can't be technology, though.
But we'd go there on off days, just if we're bored,
we'd go there just to negotiate with the ladies,
because it's so funny.
Like, you go there, and you walk in, and they're like,
oh, you want Gucci shoes?
I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like, how much?
She's like, 3,000.
I'm like, 3,000?
This is RB, so it's like one RB, or 1 is like six RB,
so 3,000 is probably like 500.
My math got like around.
My mind just exploded. My math got like around. Yeah, math.
My mind just exploded.
So she's like, 3,000.
And I'm like, 50.
And she's like, no, no, no.
No, no.
I need to feed my family, blah, blah, blah.
She's like, 2,500.
I'm like, no, 55.
She's like, no, you bad boy.
You bad boy.
I'm like, bad boy? was this a fucking robin tug
like what the fuck's going on here trying to buy fucking gucci shoes so i'm like offering you eight
dollars yeah so eventually she's like you know one thousand take your leave take your leave and
that's when most people would like pay a thousand but not me i'm like fuck that i start you gotta
walk out the door so i walk out and uh before you get five steps, she's like, okay, okay.
You can negotiate.
You negotiate.
Come back.
Come back.
And then you give her thousands of bucks.
I always give her like a little bit more just because I feel bad.
Yeah, but it's more about you learning how to negotiate.
Yeah, exactly.
It's more fun just like fucking with them.
I could be an agent.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm not good at that.
You'd love it, Biz.
You'd love it.
Oh, I feel like Biz would be just like on statues over there.
You guys should actually make a trip down there.
Yeah, we'll do a couple live podcasts maybe maybe we really plan ed and we
plan going to the olympics there yeah exactly yeah 2022 boys not that far away believe it or not and
if you're playing it here's my saying right here right now i'll go to the olympics in shanghai if
yippers on team team china oh for sure beijing beijing, either way. I'll go to the Beijing Olympics after.
Well, you can still speak Mexican.
Speak in Asian, Biz.
How much longer do you want to play?
I mean, you got to think at least three, four years if we're talking about that.
Yeah, if we're doing the Olympics, it's three more seasons.
The only thing that I feel like you don't like, oh, well, you said you found the passion
for hockey when you went to Germany.
I really can tell it is back for you.
For a while there, you were like, dude, I just want to play golf.
Fuck this.
And now you're fired up every year, I feel like.
I still want to play golf.
That's what I was going to say.
It sucks.
You have to just leaving so early.
That's so bad about Europe.
It sucks.
You got to leave a month or a month and a half early.
You obviously get home earlier, but you can't golf right now.
That's why if you're living in Florida, great. You're back and it's nice it doesn't make sense like why won't
they have the season at the same time i know they don't they want to enjoy their summers i don't get
it well they do it because of the world championships the regular season of the nhl is ends before the
world championships yeah i don't know a month before the world championships i agree because
it really i mean guys don't. They're looking to make money.
They're doing whatever they need to do.
But it does, it just sucks when you're leaving August or January 30th.
You're like, see you when I'm like, wait, what?
Yeah, I know.
Well, maybe because they want all that sunlight for the three-a-day training camps.
Yeah, exactly.
I'd keep playing until I couldn't anymore.
I mean, it's, you got fucking, all you have is adulthood.
Once you're done playing, you got to like work a real job.
Yeah, exactly.
And for guys like myself, you kind of pass that threshold where you know it's not like
you're playing in the nhl and making a you know tons and tons of money your entire career but
there's there's a time where you hit like 28 29 it's like okay is do i stop playing hockey and
focus on a new career or do i just ride this fucking thing out and make as much as i can
yeah exactly an
experience and yeah it's a great way like i always tell guys and we're talking we touched on a little
bit earlier when you when you make that decision like like the nhl is over it's it's a tough one
but and when i'm trying to recruit guys to come to my team i'm like hey listen like i'm trying to
no one can tell you what to do like that's your own decision but when you come over here here, like when I was in Germany, dude, the great experience, you meet new people.
You get these crazy two or three times, you get seven-day breaks in the middle of the season.
So we went to the Maldives.
We went to Dubai.
My first year in Germany, I went to 20 different countries.
Went to Italy, Switzerland.
We're going now.
I'm living in China, Hong Kong.
We're going to Moscow, St. Petersburg.
You're going to Kazakhstan.
You're going to Latvia.
Name the fucking country.
We're going there.
So it's a pretty cool experience, life experience.
You get a little bit of a chance to go back to being the top-lying guy, right?
Yeah, for sure.
You kind of grind it at the end of over here, and then you go over there.
You're like, dude, I'm playing power play now.
This is fun again.
Yeah, exactly. And you know what it's like when you're on your way out
and you're only playing like five to ten minutes a night
and you're just trying not to fuck up out there,
and now you go to being the guy.
I mean, it's awesome.
Nice.
Love it.
Well, buddy, thank you for joining us.
Yeah, boy, thanks for having me.
I appreciate it.
Next time we'll dig into your NHL career a little bit.
No, next time you're bringing Billy.
No, you guys will get enough of that.
Take Billy.
Have him bring the jet over.
Yeah, he will. He'll come. You should get a private flight on his jet if you re-s little bit. No, next time you bring him, no. You guys will get enough of that. Take Billy. Have him bring the jet over. Yeah, he will.
He'll come.
You should get a private flight on his jet
if you re-sign there.
Yeah, done.

Thank you very much to Yipper, Brandon Yip, who, guys, I made a promise during that interview that I could be going to fucking China.
I mean, can you imagine me in China?
No.
I'd be towering over people.
I'd look like one of the giants in Game of Thrones.
I can't imagine how great that would be, me in China.
Either way, a really cool interview from Yip.
It was interesting to hear what's kind of going on in the KHL
and trying to grow hockey in China, and him being a Phasian, boys,
he's ready to go.
I think I'm going to go out there and do a content piece
with the wonton don.
Really?
Oh, eventually.
I mean, you guys know I like to get content for the fans,
and it'd be fun for me to go over there and experience the KHL,
especially in China.
Who knows, man?
What if our brand pops off there like boy band style?
If you get big in China, boys, we'll be living large.
We'll be living like that billionaire owner who's spitting on the ground
into the walls of his fucking PJ.
Okay?
Did he say
he was chewing when he was spitting or
like loogies? I think he was just
like...
You know what it reminded me of when
he was talking about that?
The scene in
Ace Ventura.
It's like Bumblebee Tuna.
My boy. My boy.
My boy.
What up, Reggie?
We were at Steffi's on Newberry Grinnelly one time, sitting outside.
Beautiful spring day.
So, Biz, you know, it's a nice restaurant, and it's got the outdoor seating,
and it's right next to the sidewalk.
There's just, like, a fence for, like, the outdoor seating.
So, technically, like, you're kind of on the sidewalk, but you're in
a restaurant even though you're outside.
Dude, my boy's just like,
spit to the floor.
I'm like, Reg,
what are you doing? He's like, we're outside.
I'm like, bro, we're
inside the gates, bro.
We're inside the kingdom.
You can't just
hock a loogie.
I have to agree with you there.
I know it's cement and you feel it when you're on the sidewalk,
but if you're inside the gates, man,
you can't be spitting on the floor of technically what is a restaurant.
Where are you on that, R.A.?
No, I agree.
I mean, I'm a city kid, too.
That's probably what he was thinking.
I'm outside.
I'll just spit here.
But, yeah, once you're entering a restaurant, even if you're on the patio, yeah.
All right.
All right.
It's like edibles and falling asleep at the table is fine.
Just come on.
Get on the ground here.
It was a long day.
I thought they said five milligrams, not 50.
How about that draft lottery?
Why don't you lead us into that? All right. What a night. Yeah, man. New Jersey won the draft lottery? Why don't you lead us into that, all right?
What a night.
Yeah, man.
New Jersey won the draft lottery.
They get the shot at Quinn Hughes.
What was crazy, though?
Jack Hughes.
What?
Jack Hughes.
Jack Hughes.
I'm sorry.
We talked about Quinn so much on here.
I write it down.
I think it might have come up on the autocorrect.
Oh, Grinnelli popped up.
He's like, that's my boy.
Yeah, exactly.
I might get a residual kill at the fact that
i like like him if it looked like him if we do the live show in vancouver this summer i was looking
at you granelli that's why i said quinn but what was crazy guys there was that tv blip like 20
minutes before that somehow showed who the three finalists were so whoever caught that screen cap
like tweeted it out and then it proved to be true Now, I think people think that it's actually live,
like nobody there knows who wins it,
but the NHL has to do some sort of rehearsal,
I would imagine, before for a live TV event.
Obviously, they fucked up majorly
because everybody knew who the three finalists were.
When I saw the Rangers up there,
I was definitely thinking like Patrick Ewan all over again
with the NBA, they're going to rig it.
They're going to make sure the Rangers get used,
but obviously that's not how it turned out. The Devils
had an 11.5 chance of getting
the top pick, and they got it.
Colorado, they had an 18.5
chance. They ended up with the fourth pick.
Man, the Devils are looking like they might get
a franchise player, and that'll have a
big effect on whether or not Halsey
signs another UFA ticket.
A UFA ticket there too, right, Wits?
Yeah, it was crazy.
And Colorado twice now with the best odds to win the lottery
and haven't got it done.
So that's kind of bad luck for them.
I don't feel sorry for them considering they got their once-in-a-generation
player, McKinnon.
Yeah, I don't really feel sorry for them.
I won't feel sorry for if you don't get that first overall pick.
I understand that, but, like, Pittsburgh got Crosby and Malkin and Fleury.
It was like, I don't feel bad, but you can change your entire direction
of your organization based on how that lottery goes.
My main focus on the draft lottery night, though, was the GMs
and the guys that were representing the teams holy fuck guys smile
it was like they were just like panning ray shero was laughing and kind of telling a story
ray shero's awesome yeah and i think he was probably like what's going on right now like
you know i think was it bill daly or dav David Amber was describing who was representing each team?
And they go to every guy.
It's like a mugshot.
Like, oh, my God, guys, you're at the draft lottery.
Chuck a smile in the mix.
Either way, I will say that I thought for sure Chicago was going to win.
Once they were in the top three, I'm like, oh, dude.
Did you imagine?
Kane Jr. is coming to town.
I thought it was really fun, though,
how it went down. To see
these teams that you didn't expect.
Everyone going in figured it would be Colorado
and the LA Kings.
Then all of a sudden, these original
six teams, and then the Devils are involved, and then
Halsey just lit the internet on
fire with those tweets. The first
one I was laughing out loud at, I texted him.
But after that, he just kept going.
He knew how to run with it.
Coming from a guy with an organization who has no luck in the draft lottery,
Arizona, I won't even consider complaining because it's not as bad as Vancouver. I have never seen a run
with a team who has had such bad luck with the draft lottery as Vancouver. They ended up dropping
a couple spots. I don't know from what to what, but it seems like every time they have the
opportunity at, let's say, a top three or maybe even jumping up a little bit, they get bumped back. I don't know what the stat is, but one of their people who tweets out
for the Canucks organization was just saying how bad it was
and proved it by statistics.
Somebody chirped me for how I say that.
Am I saying that right, statistics?
You said it wrong once a couple weeks ago,
and that's what you get chirped on this show.
Is it statistics?
Statistically speaking, statistics.
Statistics.
Statistics.
See, I think when you bring it up, then you start thinking about it too much, you know?
But yeah, Vancouver's picking 10th, by the way, Biz.
And they got bumped back from where?
I want to say at least 7th.
Yeah, they dropped.
A few other teams did too.
Arizona, they're picking 14th, the old boys.
I think that if they really want to make that show even more exciting, though,
Biz, imagine having you or I or both of us on there,
and they would allow us to like maybe like when a team thinks
they're getting first overall and all of a sudden they drop to fourth,
we get to go interview them and be like, dude, how pissed off are you right now?
We're trying to get like, talk to me, man.
How much of a joke is it that the Rangers are getting the second overall pick?
Like, tell me your honest opinion.
Hey, I just read Twitter and people hate your guts because they think you're the bad luck charm
and they want you to quit as GM.
How do you feel about the pick?
It looks like you're in a morgue in the intro clip for you guys.
Jesus.
Yeah, pretty crazy stuff, man.
Like I said, Halsey, you know, as a free agent,
that's something to him to think about now.
But, dude, maybe he could be a prognosticator,
picking all these frigging draft lottery winners.
What's he like, five and nine?
Grinnelly, what's his hot streak at?
Yeah, he's actually five for nine, and he actually had a funny tweet about it.
He said they talk about Gretzky's 92 goals or Sittler 10 points in one game as records but they and they'll never be broken but
winning five draft lotteries in your first nine years in the league in two different draft lottery
errors no less that is a record that will stand forever wow that's a long ass tweet that was it
and it's funny too because he was a number lottery guy, too. So coming from him, it's even funnier.
I saw another tweet that made me laugh.
It said, in the six of nine seasons Taylor Hall has played in the NHL,
he's either won the MVP or won the draft lottery.
That is pretty wild.
Who wrote that?
I have no idea, but whoever did it, you made me laugh.
I don't remember.
All right.
We were just talking about front office boys.
Well, we'll switch over to behind the bench.
And what we knew pretty much was going to happen Sunday when we recorded
became official Monday morning, as expected.
Joel Quenville was named the next head coach of the Florida Panthers
Monday morning.
Before we get to that, I just want to talk to you about Indochino for a second.
I'm not sure if you guys have used them yet, but they're unreal, man.
I went and got hooked up with some fat duds not too long ago.
I'll tell you, every time you wear a suit, not only do you look better,
you feel better, you're more confident.
And Indochino was the world's most exciting made-to-measure menswear company.
They make suits and shirts to your exact measurements
for an unparalleled fit and comfort.
Someone like me, I don't have a traditional body, not a big deal.
They take care of me.
Say you're looking to get married.
They got tons of options for those looking to outfit their wedding party.
Guys love the wide selection of high-quality fabrics and colors to choose from,
not to mention the option to personalize the details,
including your lapel, your lining, pockets, buttons, and writing your own monogram.
Here's how it works.
Visit a stylist at the showroom.
There's over 40 in North America.
And have them take your measurements personally or measure at home yourself and shop our line at Indochino.com. Choose your fabric inside and out.
Choose your design customizations. Submit your measurements with your choices. Then relax while
your suit gets professionally tailored and mailed to you in a couple of weeks. This week, our
listeners can get any premium Indochino suit for just 359 at Indochino.com when entering Chicklets at
checkout. That's 50 off the regular price for a made-to-measure premium suit. Again, I got one,
you can't beat it. Plus, the shipment is free. Once more, that's Indochino.com, promo code
Chicklets for any premium suit for just 359 with free shipping. It's an incredible deal for a premium made-to-measure
suit. Once you go custom, you don't go back. He signed a five-year deal at 5.25 million per year
that can hit 7 million with bonuses. I'm guessing those bonuses are probably pretty easy because
he's making less money than other coaches, per George Richards of The Athletic. Philly was
trying to sign him as well, and they weren't outbid, but that Q wanted to work with Dale Town.
Again, Andy wanted to work with Bakov, which was interesting.
Also worth noting, Temi Panarin loved playing for Q in Chicago,
which will further fuel the Panari to Panthers rumors.
But this is a story, no surprise here.
We basically knew what was going to happen, Wits.
Yeah, Drager told us that that was probably going to go down the next day,
if not during the week.
And it's a pretty cool move if you're a player on the Panthers.
Well, maybe not everyone because I'm sure Q will be like,
he ain't playing for me next year.
But I talked to Keith Yandere and said, this is unbelievable.
To get a guy like this is such a big deal.
And Dale Tallon was in the press conference.
I was watching and he said, I'm giddy right now.
I've never been this excited.
And I think that he has all the respect in the world for Quenville
and why wouldn't he in what happened with those two guys in Chicago
and building that team.
And I just think that this is the type of coach that really can kind of change things.
And I wouldn't be surprised at all if now Panarin goes there, maybe Bobrovsky.
Maybe they get both because
I do think goaltending was an enormous
issue for the Panthers this year
it does suck, we talked about it with Dregs also
that Bugner
I don't necessarily at all think he was
a bad coach but to get Quenville
is definitely a step up and that's no
knock on Bugner but
this guy's one of the best coaches of all time
and if a couple other guys
sign there because of him and all of a sudden if you're if you're a fan of a team in the atlantic
division boston toronto florida fuck they could be a really good division and what and i'm not
even saying tampa yet so it's a good time to be a panthers fan the the seven of you
uh boys you guys have pretty much covered it all i don't need to say anything other than the fact
that i don't know if you guys listening are aware but there is zero personal state income tax
in the state of florida so coach q is going to be taking home a little bit more than he would
have if he was in say let's say chicago or even la or or New York or one of those fancy cities.
So he's going to go to Fort Lauderdale.
He's going to keep a lot more money that he earns because, once again,
no state income tax.
So the CPA biz, that's all I've got to say about that.
And, boys, a quick note here.
Perron has tied things up, so we are 1-1 St. Louis and Winnipeg right now.
So that's another series that's going to be very exciting.
Ray, what else is on the agenda?
Just while we're at it, the Islanders are three minutes from taking a
one-nothing series lead, but still a little ways to go just while we're
doing scores.
One other coaching note, one-time Hyannis Port president Bruce Boudreaux
will be back behind the bench in Minnesota next year.
GM Paul Fenton was asked about an extension.
He just said, Bruce is my coach next year.
So there was a little bit of speculation about him coming back,
and he will be back.
We just talked about Ray Sherrill a minute ago.
He had a hell of a Tuesday.
Not only did he get the number one draft pick,
also signed a multi-year contract with the Devils,
so he'll be around for a little while.
And I'm not sure, did you catch that clip, boys,
of the Swedish Hish hockey league forward
john i don't know if it's pronounced canutes or canuts or not so what he was found in his gear
celebrating a huge win with fans 36 miles from the arena his team played in he was celebrating
uh if i can pronounce this correctly lex sans ifs promotion back to sweden's top division after
winning a best of seven series he was shirtless in the snow in Sweden, too.
He still had his blades on.
Nobody knew how he got there or where he ended up there.
Grinnelli, they tracked him down two days later.
We got that audio.
Let's run it, man.
It's hilarious.
First of all, I have to apologize for not having any votes left.
I don't know how many votes left, I understand.
And the scrimmage, too.
There will be a lot. I don't even know what he was saying, and that's funny,
because you can just tell how big of a bender he'd just been on.
I think he thought he was trying to keep up to Ovi or something
after that cup win last year.
What do you think, Ari?
Between Ovi and when Portnoy, what Super Bowl was it, Whitney,
when he was smoking a cigar and he couldn't talk like this?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
That's exactly what it reminded me of.
I was in Russia, and I remember watching the rundowns in Russia
because it was like, you know, you look forward to something to watch every day,
and that was like the best rundown of all time.
He's like, big cap.
Couldn't even speak.
So that was good.
That was good shit.
All right.
There are a couple new series stars tonight, so I got to give a couple picks.
Do a quick little gambling corner here for the folks who are still tailing me.
Obviously, I just said I like the Bruins.
They're only a 6-7 favorite, minus 140.
Got to put up 700 to make a nickel.
They're not too big of a favorite, so I thought they'd be a little higher.
I'm going to take the Bruins for five units to win the series.
Also, per custom, take them in game one for two and a half units.
I'm also going to take the Canes.
I like the Canes for an upset.
I'm going to take them.
Yes!
Yes!
Pittsburgh Titans?
Pittsburgh Titans?
Yeah.
Empty net?
Was their net empty?
Fucking right it was.
Paul Dillon, fuck you, Borelli, and you scumbag Islander fans.
My former teammate, Rocket Rocket one-timer.
I'm watching the fucking game in a mirror so he looks like a lefty.
He's a righty in real life.
That's a Rocket.
That's a tie game.
And Witt's got a big bet on the money line of the Pittsburgh Penguins.
Let's go!
Dude, the fucking
You hear the guys yelling too?
Boys, everyone's got the pens tonight in this household.
Seriously.
Let me give a quick shout-out to my boy, Ned Havern.
A hole-in-one on the cradle course today.
No fucking way.
Ned, he got a hole-in-one?
Yeah, but it kind of doesn't count because the Pinehurst built this awesome
nine-hole par-three course.
The distance ranges from about 50 yards to 115 yards.
So technically, I guess it doesn't really count as a hole-in-one,
but for everyone here, our boy got a hole-in-one.
So he ripped his shirt off, ran around.
We were crushing John Daly's.
It was a great day, and we got Thursday, we got Friday.
It's just the beginning, but the house is ripping it with that Penguins goal.
We need an overtime win.
All right, sorry about that.
I just went nuts.
I got it right behind me.
So continue your gambling corner.
No problem, brother.
So, again, Bruins for the series, five units.
Bruins game one for two and a half units.
And I'm going to go to the Canes, man.
Fuck it.
I'll put my money where my mouth is.
Canes to win the series for five units and game one for two and a half units.
I'm not touching Calgary, Colorado.
Calgary is too high of a price, and I don't like Colorado enough for an upset. So this week's gambling corner is brought to you by ZipRecruiter. Hiring is challenging, but there's one place you can go where hiring is

after talking about Free Solo, the documentary with that dude climbing El Capitan, the nut.
Yeah. Apparently he did it the night or two nights before and then went and did it again
because he wanted to know he could
do it on camera yeah he was gonna die i don't think he wanted to be on camera so kind of crazy
that that it really did come off as that was his first time but it makes a little sense to me
because he did get to the top and he wasn't that excited i didn't maybe he's so weird that he
wouldn't have been that excited when he was alone alone. But maybe it was obviously  not maybe,
but he obviously might have had a tough time acting
if he had already done it before on his own.
So I was interested to hear that from a couple people on Twitter.
And I figure I'd give a Jimmy Johns update of the week
because I have continued to get messages in my inbox.
This is from another guy.
More Jimmy Johns slander. slander hey biz i just listened
to the new podcast i have a co-worker who was a jimmy john store manager for a while and said the
same thing about them being cheap he said they make a real big deal about the napkins too and
that's why they are behind the counter and you have to reach over the counter to get them so
holy shit so so any jimmy john's employee who has things to complain about,
just send them to my inbox because these guys are just getting torched.
And, I mean, this guy, me and this guy would both be in the bathroom
waiting for the bill to be paid if we went to dinner together.
I would never go to a place that kept the napkins by the fucking behind the counter.
Where else would I get the napkins from my glove compartment
if they keep them behind the counter?
Yeah, how else are you going to fucking towel off after a shower? by the fucking behind the counter. Where else would I get the napkins from my glove compartment if they keep me in the counter?
Yeah, how else are you going to fucking towel off after a shower?
Oh, well.
What's up, Whit?
Nothing.
I also forgot to mention that a while back, somebody, Pinehurst Caddy,
you remember he called into the Barstool Sports Golf Podcast for a play and bad-mouthed me?
And I said, when I went there,
when I was going there in April, I was going
to find this guy. Well, today,
I went down there. I said to
this guy, hey, does anyone know
this guy, the caddy who called into
foreplay? I don't know his name. One of my buddies
here listened. He said it was Brandon or Brendan.
The guy goes, I know who you're talking about, man.
We got a bunch of people here. I'm going
back tomorrow. I'm going to try to re-explain it again,
and I'm going to try to get some answers for why this little fucking scumbag rat
didn't say a word to my face but called into a podcast and slandered my name.
Grinnell, you look like you got something to say.
I mean, we have a lot of listeners that I'm sure they listen to Foreplay, too.
I think they could identify his name real quick.
Just get me the guy's name.
I mean, it doesn't matter.
I went down there. I said, who's the caddy here who called in the guy's name. I mean, it doesn't matter. I went down there.
I said, who's the caddy here who called in the Barstool Sports?
I mean, it's a factory here.
They have, like, 19 courses, and, like, the carts are coming in.
Oh, I was going to say, so I'm like, how do they not know, like,
the one guy?
But you're saying it's probably, what, 150 employees?
Some might not even cross paths.
Yeah, I mean, a little, yeah, whatever. We're whatever we're gonna get but don't i didn't
want anyone to be like oh what's the pioneers he's not gonna do what he said no i'm gonna do what i
said um i got a quick story too so i i did that uh that zamboni race uh with sports net and amazon
the one john scott the content piece i talked about earlier in the show and i was like why
why are we calling these things ice resurfacers
and not Zambonis?
And they said, well, Zamboni.
Well, yeah, but apparently Zamboni is an own name.
And it's like we couldn't use the name because if we would have used
the name Zamboni, which everyone calls those,
they would have probably sued us.
And I think they reached out to him and they confirmed
that they would have came after us. Like I think they reached out to him and they confirmed that they would have came after us.
What the fuck is that?
It's like when you can't say the word
Super Bowl during the Super Bowl.
If you're doing a broadcast before the game
and you don't have the rights, they
can't say Super Bowl. That's fucking
insane.
So is Frank Zamboni
your new Neo
or whoever that rapper was who wouldn't let you use their song?
No, it was Kygo.
Kygo.
He's Frank Zamboni.
Okay.
So then even further, like we were having a discussion with the crew there and I'm like, really?
I'm like, people are out of control.
Like if somebody like there was a bar that put up a spit and chiclets chalkboard, like where they drew it in and they were serving Pink Whitney's.
Like, I'm not going to send a cease and desistist like you're you know it's just like not to that extent
and even the fact that they're profiting off of it i mean maybe there would be like a deal to work
out later if they kept doing it and it got out of control but like to say the word zamboni is
ridiculous and and then we got talking about it and and they were saying that even in movies or TV shows now, if you're like in LA, let's say, and in behind you, there's a building that has graffiti on it.
You have to fucking pay that graffiti artist.
And I'm thinking, what?
If he got permission to do graffiti, let's say on a wall of a property that's owned,
how does the guy graffitiing on a building that's not his get paid and the guy whose building it is doesn't see a dollar of it?
That guy owns the property, plays property tax on that land.
So all of a sudden you graffiti on a wall and you tag it
and all of a sudden I got to get a paycheck if somebody wants to put it in.
If it just so happens to be in something, even
in passing by, not if you're like doing
a piece on that exact tag.
I don't know. I just got a little irritated by
that where it just seems like everyone's so
sue happy now. Greed, man.
Fucking greed. Greed. Greed
is right, R.A. Now,
that was a great show, boys. I hope everybody
enjoys Stanley Cup playoffs. Boys, is
there anything better than the first round of Stanley Cup?
No.
And listen, golf season's coming, and I'm the happiest.
Like, right now, like, if you need a loan, call me now.
Like, I'm just in an incredible mood.
So, these games are awesome.
We got some more 10 o'clock, 10.30 starting soon.
And the next two, three, four weeks, we got games every night.
So, it's a great time to do a podcast,
and it's a great, great time to listen to Spittin' Chicklets.
A lot of free hockey tonight too, boys.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Free boochy overtime challenge.
All right, guys.
Hey, well, let's do it.
Let's predict.
I mean, we're online here, boys.
Okay, and you know what, Biz?
I got a good idea.
If you're not a usual gambler.
All of us, we're going to throw in 20 bucks a guy.
I'm not going to go high stakes.
We're going to throw 20 bucks a guy, and I'm going to start, and I'm going to pick who scores a goal for the Islanders if they win,
and then we snake draft it.
It'll go R.A., Biz, Grinnelli,
and then Grinnelli can pick a Pittsburgh player first.
We'll go 20 bucks a guy.
I say for the Islanders, Jordan Eberle.
Can I step in here for one second?
I think to make it fair for the whole group, and, I mean, Grinnelli bets those.
I just made it fair.
Right, but 20 may be a bit much.
I say we do the challenge, and if nobody gets it, that stays in the pot.
So the next game, it's another 20.
Oh, 100.
Oh, yeah.
Fuck it.
So you want to stick with the 20 number?
Roll over.
Okay, so roll over to you.
Islanders, Eberle.
All right, who's your Islanders pick?
Islanders, I'm going to go with  fuck.
Kunakl.
Kunakl again.
Kunakl. You're a fucking Kunakl. Iakl again. Kunakl.
You're a fucking Kunakl.
I'm going to go with Anders Lee.
I got Casey Sezikis.
And you got Pittsburgh first pick.
I'm going to go with Jake Gensel.
Wow, you fucker.
God.
I'm going to go with the fucking golden boy.
I'm going Sid, baby.
Come on, Sidney.
I'm going to go with the fucking golden boy. I'm going Sid, baby. Come on, Sidney. I'm going to go Gino Monk.
Oh, so I go fourth and I get Kessel.
Fill the thrill.
He's already got one tonight.
All right.
All right, boys.
Good luck.
And if nobody gets it, we got 80 in the pot for next overtime challenge.
And, guys, when Sid sends one five hole on Leonard,
just Venmo me that money tonight.
Talk to you on Sunday.
Everyone, thanks for listening. Peace out.
Good luck with the caddy.
Thank you very much. I said, please don't be
a lefty. All of a sudden I get my eyes
punched shut. I was going to say,
shadow boxing in that mirror.
The caddy comes out and he's like, oh yeah, it was me.
You have an issue? He's a UFC fighter.
I don't get to play golf.
Alright, guys.
Peace out.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
