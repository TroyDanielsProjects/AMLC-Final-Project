It's my duty to please the booty.
And Muzz got mad at me. The coach said, he goes, Jesus Christ, why don't you just wear two nines?
And I went, okay.
Stop! I'll stretch the car!
Please, please, please never do that.
Yep.
Stop.
Stop.
That's the power of the game. Please never do that.
Yep.
Ciao.
Hello, everybody.
Welcome to episode 511 of Spittin' Chicklets, presented by Pink Whitney.
From our friends at New Amsterdam Vodka, here in the Barstool Sports Podcast family.
Holy shit, boys.
What a cup.
What a season.
What a run.
We're here in Vegas for the draft.
Biz, how you doing, buddy?
I'm doing awesome.
Just first off, congratulations to the Florida Panthers
on a Stanley Cup victory.
Well-deserved.
What a season, boys.
Start to finish, and what a way to cap it off.
Great Game 7.
Now we're obviously in Las Vegas where we have the NHL Awards in draft,
but a lot to dive into, including that Game 7,
and just a lot of tire pumping to go around for the Florida Panthers
on what they assembled.
An absolute juggernaut back to the finals, back-to-back years.
Bill Zito created a monster in this team,
and well-deserved to him and everybody involved with that staff.
No doubt. We'll dive in a little bit more.
We've got to bring in the Mermin.
Matt Murley, how are you doing, my friend?
I'm doing great.
That Game 7, it lived up to everything.
The pregame before, Terry Ryan gets us a bus over there.
We had a Chicklets Charter bus going over.
It was insane.
We got over.
We had the tailgate you set up, late Pink Whitney pop-up.
Just set the tone for a great night.
And like you said, the Panthers, they've been the best team in the East
for almost two years now, a year and a half, and congrats to them.
It was nice having Terry Ryan there because R.A. wasn't the drunkest guy.
For once.
To the end of the game.
I don't even know if Terry Ryan even got into the arena,
but yeah, he showed up at Elbow Room about 3 o'clock.
I'm like, Terry, the game starts in five and a half hours.
I was spitting on our drinks and stuff.
But you guys said it best.
It was an incredible season.
What a game seven effort by the Panthers.
They just locked everything down.
They looked exactly like the team we'd seen run through the East
and the first three games of the finals.
They deserved everything they got.
That 3-0 lead, while Oilers came back and tied it, it was just too much.
It was just too much to overcome.
Amazing run by them to get back into it. But the Panthers were incredible. Once, I apologize for
my voice. It's not good. A lot of screaming, a lot of yelling for the Oilers in that game seven.
Not many chances, but also this show is presented by Pink Whitney. I got to get that out there.
New Amsterdam's own Pink Whitney, pink lemonade flavored vodka. We have a special meet and greet
today after this at Stadium Swim at Circa G. Is at circa g is that where it is circus you can come over there 5 30 in vegas time
hopefully we see everyone over there and thank you so much to pink whitney now the series was uh
i'd say as back and forth and in as incredible as i can remember i think elliot friedman put
out a tweet before game seven that this is the biggest game in the history of the NHL.
He mentioned Game 7 with the Rangers
and the Canucks. That was probably a pretty good comparison.
But just what this meant,
the possibility of blowing the 3-0
lead. I think the Red Wings had done it
in 1942. You think back
to the Yankees in 2004
and baseball of being known as the
biggest choke artist ever. And that was sitting
in front of the Panthers. And then they came out and they performed to a level that i did not expect i
thought the momentum of the final three games of the series four five and six would lead edmonton
and you could tell right off the hop right off the hop that they had something different that night
i said in the box we were sitting and right before the game i said i don't love that bobrovsky didn't
skate yesterday as an Oilers fan.
I said that right away.
I would guess, and I'd love to find out someday, if Maurice told him,
listen, stay away.
We talked about this.
Don't even come to the rink.
Go recharge.
Go just take it all in.
And right now, there's some panic, but you'll be ready to go.
And I think that was the perfect recipe because he looked exactly how he looked
earlier in the playoffs.
You couldn't get anything on him. And then the defense didn't even really allow that many chances to begin with so
we'll go into the game a little bit but there's also another elephant in the room that's our ray
i don't know if we want i lost 40 pounds bro elephant joke oh okay you lost some weight you
did not lose any hate though because right now I would say you're the
most hated man in the internet for NHL related things. There are people who want you done.
Now I would love to maybe, I don't know if you want to go into this now or we go into the game,
but if you want to set it up a little bit, R.A. has actually picked the Panthers to win every
series this playoff. So have I. Yeah, so have you, and so have you, and we'll get into that
because you're a little involved in this as well.
I believe you even picked them to beat the Bruins, R.A., right?
I honestly don't remember.
I made it up.
Okay, there you go.
So R.A., being a Panthers fan, being very close to the Kachuks,
he's mentioned that a million times, decides to go with the Panthers,
and it makes total sense.
We get to Edmonton, and I don't really know what happened, R.A., but you kind of just,
I guess, fell like within the city, like fell in love with the team and the vibe and how crazy it
was going. And you just turned into a diehard Oilers fan. You're shaking Biz's belly jersey
over the moss pit. You're dancing around the owner's suite. You're going bananas for Oilers goals, which is your right, no doubt.
You want to do whatever you want to do.
And if you want to be a turncoat, you can be a turncoat.
And if you want to be a turncoat or a bandwagon-jumping motherfucker,
as Sean Thornton said, that is your right.
The game ends, and it was mentioned by Grinnell,
yeah, Ari and I were going down to the ice.
You're coming down.
I looked at you like I said, you think I'd ever go down there?
I'm a blatant Oilers fan, an Oilers stan, as they say.
I could never and would never think about showing my face down there.
I would think people would see me and say, what the fuck are you doing down here?
Now, I want to ask you, R.A., you had to have some idea that you being down there made no sense.
you had to have some idea like that you being down there made no sense like i don't really understand how you thought you could go down there and be in their face after for 10 days
literally be dancing around the entire city of edmonton celebrating oilers goals as you work as
if you worked for the team and also the fact that my understanding is you received a prior text
after game four from fromachuk, Walt,
basically being like, I'm tired of your Oilers shit.
Is that true?
I believe it was all of us.
I can pull it up if you'd like.
First off, go back to what am I doing on the ice?
2019 Stanley Cup, I rooted for the Bruins for seven games.
They lost at home ice.
I went down and interviewed the Blues.
I did my fucking job.
I went down and talked to Boatuzzo.
I talked to Pat Maroon.
I was a fucking professional.
I went down and did what I was supposed to do. So that's what I was doing
this time. All right. You had no voice
either. That wasn't brought up. So I don't know if
maybe you had a choke collar. I don't know. You had a
diamond encrusted choke collar.
A plastic diamond encrusted
choke holder necklace. You had
zero voice and you were going
bananas for the Oilers the past like
10 days. I have a confession. On the bus
on the way to the rink, I specifically stopped them and said, R.A., I love that choker on you. Don't take it off the
rest of the night. So that might be on me. Okay, so that's on Biz. And R.A., I want you to speak,
no doubt. You were one of the hosts of this show. But nevertheless, you go down on the ice
and the videos, I mean, there's more that haven't came out that we can release. There are more, folks. I probably watched those videos 500 times yesterday.
I mean, it's just amazing.
Like, your face, it's kind of shock.
But whatever.
So you're pigeon-tossed on the ice.
After that, what in your mind makes you think to go in the locker room?
That's where it's at.
That's crazy.
Probably the fact that I was invited to go in by one of the players.
Who?
Okay, who?
You don't want to give names.
I don't snitch.
I ain't fucking saying who.
Okay, okay.
So there you go.
So he was invited in.
I didn't know that.
Wait, a couple clues.
Did the player...
I'm not saying anyone's name.
I'm not throwing anyone in the box.
No, we're not saying names.
Did the player have a point in the game?
Was he dressed?
I'm not giving any clues at who it is.
I'm protecting fucking anonymity here.
Was it the mascot?
No, it was not the mascot.
It was definitely a roster player.
And I didn't just walk in.
I was brought in by a player.
Actually, I could even say two guys I walked in with.
And then when fucking Matthew fucking said he's an Oilers fan,
which is hilarious because I don't even own fucking Oilers merch.
I bet Florida.
And I only said because I'm a fucking U kid.
That's the reason I was rooting for Florida.
And then another player said, no, he's okay, and they're like, nope, he wants
him out of here, and then I get thrown out of the building, and I don't
have my fucking phone, because I gave it to this goofball
Pasha over there to take videos,
so now I'm outside the arena, in the middle of a fucking swamp,
no cabs, no Uber, no phone,
no way to get home, thank Christ I had a credit card
in my pocket, so I could get the fuck back to the hotel.
So you're worked up about this, and you feel
like you were... I feel like I'm fucking
defending on all sides here, you know?
Well, I mean, honestly, buddy, if you haven't
like, and I'm not going to sit here and say
that like online comments
are the be all end all. They are not by
any means. They are not by any means.
But at some point you look
and you're like, holy shit, there's like a
tidal wave of momentum against RA
right now. There has to be some sort of maybe regret in your mind.
And you tweeted out yesterday, no regrets, correct?
No regrets. No regrets at all.
What have we been saying? Twitter's fake life.
Twitter's fake life. We've been saying that for eight years.
But it's also not because Chucky, Walt, Sean Thornton, and I'm sure a few other guys in which I saw.
Who?
Verhage.
Verhage. There's a lot of guys who felt this animosity towards you.
So it's carried over from Twitter to say maybe Twitter's not real life is fine.
But there was also real players in the game that were involved in this that wanted you pigeon-talked.
Yeah, well, I think it was maybe one player on that team.
I think it was Matthew Kachuk.
I talked to Sam Bennett after the game, who I wrote about during the Masha on shit.
I called him a lunatic.
He didn't give two fucks.
And the league players have never given a fuck what the
media says. I've never seen guys mad
at what we said before. Now, I know we go way
back, but what am I? I'm in a box in Edmonton.
We're guests of the Cates. We're having fun. I'm dancing
around with a little soup there. And like what?
Oh, the Kachuks might get mad if I'm fucking having fun
in the Edmonton box. Fuck that. How do I?
I'm going to do what I want to do. Like, if they're pissed off, I don't
care. I don't give a fuck
if they're mad.
I, you know,
I did what I did
and fucking,
like I said,
I bet them.
I fucking rooted for them
because of the fucking
family friends
going back a hundred years
and they want to be pissed
about it
and they wanted to be petty
and whatever.
That's their fucking right.
Just like it's my right
to fucking say
I got no regrets
and also,
you know how many
fucking texts I got?
I got four NHLers
texting me yesterday.
Family members of the Kachuk
saying how fucking embarrassing
it was what they did.
That's the fucking difference with the internet, okay?
The internet, yeah, whatever.
The internet's going to do the internet shit.
I don't give a fuck if people hate me or not.
But I got texts from fucking family members, former NHLers saying how fucking embarrassing it was that went down.
And they weren't fucking talking about me.
That's why I get no fucking regrets.
So this is a majorly, majorly divisive topic now.
I just want to say, I was there too.
Keith was very nice to me.
I talked to him.
He busted my balls at first.
So there's something.
He's not betrayed by our...
I don't know what...
Yeah, maybe there's something there because they grew up together.
But he said to me after, like, don't worry.
Somebody said the same.
There is something to be said because I wondered.
I said, oh, maybe they hate me too.
But I've been an Oilers fan.
Like, if they want to hate me, I really, really don't care.
That is their right.
Maybe it's more so the family and the relation that you've had with the Chucks for that long
where they look at you celebrating and kind of enjoying them collapsing this series as
it went on and looking at it like this motherfucker is not being loyal.
You make a good point that you really don't care.
Now, personally, if I had just won the Stanley Cup,
I probably really wouldn't care about anything,
but I'm never going to judge anyone for kind of what they're doing and feeling,
and they were pissed off enough to really, really make you look like a fool on the ice.
So I was a little bit surprised about it.
I think partly, though, maybe some of the fans and their thing is that you are down there, you're
pretty fucked up and you do have no voice.
So it kind of looks a little odd when you're, you know,
Sasha Barkov's biggest moment of his life
and you really can't talk as you're interviewing.
Now saying that, Sasha
Barkov, what was it?
Portnoy texted you saying he should
win the conspite for taking... He deserves the conspite for
doing that.
That's hilarious. That's hilarious.
What a classy guy. And he actually answered
your question and somehow understood it.
Barkoff did. Bill Zito
talked to me. I tried to grab him. Paul Maurice. By the way, his two sons,
great kids, they come over. They were gracious in defeat.
Gracious in victory. Talk to them. They were
super nice about it. So as far as
the Kachukas, we've been championing the three of them
for fucking eight years on the show.
If anything, that should be like we're entertainers at the end of the day. We're growing the game. We've been championing the three of them for fucking eight years on this show. And I get family history.
If anything, that should be like,
we're entertainers at the end of the day.
We're growing the game.
We're having fun.
And everyone else seems to fucking remember that.
And you could say,
we go back all these years, whatever.
I just thought, if anything,
that would afford me a little more fucking,
I don't know, leg room or whatever to not get shit on.
But you know what?
It happened.
It is what it is.
Like I said, I got a lot of messages
from fucking family, friends, whatever,
that had no issue with what I did whatsoever.
I'm hoping we can get Matthew and Walt on to bury the hatchet.
Or put a hatchet into his throat.
But I think that what he just said leads into another thing,
because there are people that have been just furious with the Spanning Chicklets podcast
for about two weeks now.
And I think part of it goes into that we are clowns.
Like, we've always been pretty open.
We are not normal media.
We come off as media and analysts, I guess you could say,
but we have this incredible following.
I love our fans.
You could come up to me, and I've had people come up to me.
You drive me fucking crazy on the podcast.
I've had people say, Whit, I love you on the podcast.
I love it all because if you're listening, I appreciate it. No matter
if you hate listening, honest to God.
I think people are really
having a tough time separating
us and regular media in which
regular media is not biased.
There is no bias. You listen to Elliot
and Jeff. You listen to Sara Valli
and Gregor. They are very, very
down the middle, which is the correct way to do
things. There's no cheering in the press box.
That's just never really how this has been.
Biz has seven favorite teams.
I had the Oilers minus two weeks.
R.A. had the Bruins and kind of the Panthers.
But now he's the Spies minor.
R.A. has a Panthers travel bag he brings on every road trip.
He's got a Matthew Kachuk chain with his face on it.
Like, he's our biggest panthers guy now also
in fairness ra you sent the group text a picture yesterday of sean thornton writing your message
still love you bud so maybe that that one of the three there was walt there was matt and there was
sean thornton the video compilation brady dissed me too off camera yeah and not to be not to be
lost here and even paul marie's talked about it like after they'd blown
the three three games for you know they got to sit on that for two days so a lot of stress and
implications involved when these guys are in the middle of the fight as to maybe why they had that
built up emotion towards you and by the way ra i'm very proud of the way you've handled yourself
and backed yourself up so far in this first 10 minutes because you have you look like the
fucking lincoln lawyer right now yeah no no backing down and then giving his points and now i think
the videos though i mean if i'm ever in a bad mood dude when i see big salt say fuck you i'm
done with you and then your face like it looked like you were gonna cry matthew in the locker
room being like he'd already told him 20 times so then he goes a lot when you went in the locker room, he'd already told him 20 times. Yeah, so then he goes in the locker room. When you went in the locker room, and then I'm just
Matthew had already on the ice said, get away from me.
So when you went back up in the locker room to him,
did you think maybe, like, I'll try again?
Like, maybe
Yeah, just a handshake, congratulatory thing.
I said, you know, maybe the heat of the moment right afterwards.
But the fact that he, again, had me thrown out of the room,
the building with no phone, whatever,
I just think there would probably be a better way to handle it.
Now, to your point, yes, I know you've got to sort of create maybe anger in your head sometimes
or imagine your enemies are real enemies or whatever to fuel what you're doing to win the Stanley Cup.
I just thought it was just fucking  I didn't expect that.
I was surprised often.
You said every time you're in a bad mood, you watch a video.
So what, about 500 times a day you watch?
Yeah, exactly. There you go. Anytime I'm down so maybe every once an hour i'm just
gonna pull up already on the ice getting pigeon tossed by his lifelong friends and i'm and i'm
just as guilty as jumping on the oilers bandwagon and obviously that's you you're but but another
thing too i i said before the series started, I thought Florida was overall the better team.
I picked Florida in six.
I wanted a good series.
And when it was down 3-0, or yeah, when it was down even 2-0,
I hadn't been to Florida yet, right?
So I hadn't been and mucked it up with the crowd.
So when we got to Edmonton and we felt that energy,
and especially after they go down 0-3,
once they had that big victory in game four,
like I'm just pumped up and fired up and i
want edmonton to come back to for the for the sake of hockey and obviously being up there with all
you guys and joey supersteen and all the rest of the edmonton fans i got really wrapped up to it
especially being in canada and just seeing the way that the fans up there treated us and embraced us
so i'm as guilty as just as much ra but never in my wildest dreams would I go down to the ice,
and even if Edmonton had won,
because I feel like it's taking away from their moment.
But once again, R.A., you're more of a fan than me.
You never played, so I feel like you maybe have more of that right
to go down there with the diamond-encrusted choker
and without a voice to talk to Sasha Barker.
I would say maybe another part and dude
i i am not a great dresser i know that but like you had a houston astros hat on like a tom petty
shirt like maybe some chiclets merch or something and then the diamond encrusted call the diamond
choker was like it's i i just didn't really get and i think more than anything my number one thing
would have been ra all right, one,
don't go down on the ice because you've been dancing around Edmonton
like Daryl Cates, and two, you had no voice.
So it was like the no voice thing I think probably in your mind
should have maybe been like, I don't know if right now is the time
to go down and interview.
And he was on every substance you could imagine.
You called him Steve Montour.
You didn't even know it was Brandon Montour.
No, I got the name confused.
Yeah, you got a lot confused because you were fucked up.
You were mangled, all right.
I got Montour Montador.
Steve Montador passed away.
It was a fucking brain jumble.
That's all it was, Montour Montador.
That's all.
It was that simple.
We lost a poor fellow.
I didn't want to have to bring his name up.
And like, all right, you snapped back at me, which I really like that.
Like you said, I rooted for the Bruins, and I went down in 2019 and did my job because I'm a journalist.
Journalists don't get blacked out during the games.
They don't, dude.
I watched a game with you guys.
Yeah, you were crippled.
I beg to differ.
I don't think I was crippled.
I was anywhere else.
What the fuck, R.A.?
R.A.
All pisses out of here. R.A. R.A. All pisses out of here
R.A.
R.A.
I'm not saying I have a puff
But I fucking wanted
I was sitting next to the
R.A. you were ripping joints
And crushing Pink Whitney
And getting fucked up
So if you're gonna say
You're a journalist
I didn't say that
You did
I'm joking
At the beginning of the show
You said in 2019
I went down
Because I'm a journalist
You were crippled
I went down Dude we were in a box You were crippled. I went down.
All right.
Well, dude, we were in a box.
There was hardly any booze in the box, dude.
I literally had fucking...
Tell me.
I mean, I was sitting with you guys.
I watched the game with you guys.
I fucking...
Whatever.
We cannot get the merits of what I would have blown, a.8 or a.02 or a.04.
I'm just saying you can't...
I want a blood test.
You can't say...
I want a blood test.
You can't say I go down on the ice because I'm a journalist.
No.
If you're crippled.
They don't get crippled.
That's why I never say I'm a journalist, dude.
I go out and I have a couple beers.
I enjoyed the game.
It was the most amazing pregame vibe in that arena.
Barkley was there.
Stephen A. Smith's there.
We're next to Gary Bettman.
The nerves, the energy.
Sorry, Tampa, Jesus.
Florida's fans showed up in spades.
They were awesome.
Considering you guys mentioned to me in game five, it wasn't great.
They were amazing.
Getting the first goal really mattered.
But dude, like you can't tell me that you're a journalist and then you get blacked out
and go down on the ice.
I'm not going to fucking sit here and let you say that.
Like, I'm sorry, dude.
I dispute that I was on everything under the sun and that was blacked out.
So whatever.
We can have your day.
You slept on the beach.
You slept on the beach, dude.
Yeah, because it took me two hours to get out of that arena
to get home. I was exhausted.
I almost got in two fucking fights. I sat down to catch my breath
and it fucking took me.
All right. It took you, yeah, having no phone,
getting kicked out of the arena, that's a disaster.
You had a hotel room key
and slept on the beach and you're trying to say
you weren't crippled.
Okay.
They're like two different things.
Yeah.
That was three hours fucking later, dude.
I was aggravated.
I sat down fucking after the bar closed,
and then fucking zonked out because I just fucking was exhausted.
I was beat.
I was tired, dude.
It took me fucking hours to get out of there.
Oh, whatever.
I think we're coming to the end of the argument.
Yes, yes.
Please.
Sick of it.
What was your favorite interview on the ice, if we can ask you?
I thought Bill Zito was pretty good.
I thought, you know, I was basically bringing up,
I thought the way the game ended was a perfect metaphor of the Panthers.
They just snuffed out the others for that last 10, 15 seconds in that corner.
Essentially choked them out, choked their season out.
And that's what I asked Bill about.
That's a journal answer right there. All right. answer right there all right then just pass over the pipe but hey so let's go into
the game a little bit please the game oh i i was i was very excited as i just mentioned and you know
there's going to be a little bit of nerves obviously within the players florida came out
hot dude they came out they were chipping pucks. And I thought, randomly enough, Mikula looked awesome.
Unbelievable.
He was jumping into the play.
He was looking very good.
Barkov, right off the hop, was in McDavid's face, taking away time and space.
And I thought, more than anything, Pasha said this too.
About 10 minutes into the game, Florida was throwing everything at net.
And that's something they've done for a long time,
but maybe had gotten away from as the Oilers kind of overtook that series. But everything was going everything at net. And that's something they've done for a long time, but maybe had gotten away from as the Oilers kind of overtook that series.
But everything was going to the net.
And then how does that first goal get scored?
Evan Rodriguez, what a signing by Bill Zito.
Another amazing move by him.
I think it's 3 million for four years, maybe 4 million for three years.
I'm not exactly sure.
But not a ton of money for the production that he's given them.
Throws one on net.
And the guy who was getting called out more than anyone,
Carter Verhege, with a sick tip.
I think that puck was going about three feet wide,
and he just reaches across, tips it in, and Florida's going.
And that was kind of our thing going into the game was I think it's first goal wins.
The first three games, Florida scored the first three goals, they won.
Then Edmonton scored the first three goals in games four through six, they won.
And it just felt like that, and boom, it seemed like that was the end.
But they answered quick, didn't they?
That pass by Cody Ceci, dude.
Cody fucking McCarr, man.
What a fucking play that was.
And Janmark, just what a playoff for that guy.
Four goals, four assists for Janmark.
And really, the third and fourth line, in my opinion, for the Oilers
really stepped up since the end of Game 3.
And they kept them in the series, and they scored some big, pivotal goals for them.
And when you talk about Barkov smothering McDavid in the games that he did,
the last two, no points for McDavid, it was really those bottom six guys
who were stepping up
and giving him and providing him that energy.
But going back, you mentioned Mikula.
I just felt like overall, the back end, like Montour,
we talked about his struggles, maybe compared to last season overall.
Last playoffs, he was remarkable.
And then he had that injury coming in, so he missed time.
I don't think he was ever really able to get his feet underneath him like he did last year. But to a man, the back end for the Florida Panthers in that game seven, they looked like they did in game two of the series. And I think it was you who said that. Game one, they really leaned on Bob, but they really got back to the foundation of their game where they had their D-men jumping in, staying aggressive, keeping plays alive
by pinching and staying in the offensive zone,
which helps your forwards drastically.
Their gaps were tight in the neutral zone,
great sticks.
I think the Janmark goal,
was it like a semi-breakaway?
It was a breakaway.
It was a breakaway,
and I believe that was one of the only odd-man rushes
they'd given up all game long,
if you look at the numbers.
You go back to last year, too. Gudis and Mark Stahl had incredible runs. odd man rushes they've given up all game long if you look look at the numbers and you know you go
back to last year too like gudas and mark stall had incredible runs bill zito and you talked about
him bringing in evan rodriguez and we'll go to the other crazy moves he's make like kachuk but
bringing in micola and oliver eckman larson i thought paid massive massive dividends to the
point where i thought they were two of their besties throughout this entire series if you look at the full seven games.
And going back to your point, R.A., it was fitting that in that last 15 seconds
they put the Anaconda chokehold on them.
McDavid was in front of the net a long time.
And to a man, they just suffocated him all game long.
Not a ton of glorious opportunities.
I think Dreisaitl had a few that he whiffed on
where he's normally on that offside for the one-timer.
And then maybe you could look at that one late in the game
where McDavid set up Hyman.
But once again, Forsling tying up his stick.
Bobrovsky's down.
He has that split second to put it in the open cage.
But no, it goes back to the six men, all of them.
Ekblad, everybody stepped
up in that game seven to lock shit down.
Actually, that was the fifth straight
breakaway goal by the Oilers in that series.
Five breakaways in a row they scored on Bobrovsky
in that series. Pretty wild stuff.
I feel like they all were to his blocker, too. They were
coming across going blocker side, so they might have
figured something out there. Congrats to
the coach that figured that out. Guys,
beat him that way. Watch out next year, Bob.
Everybody's going to be trying to blocker on you.
And I know you mentioned a couple of Leon chances.
Right after they made it 2-1, the Panthers did,
after Reinhardt scored, which we can go into that goal,
kind of a tough defensive play.
They just sat back and didn't pressure.
But McDavid brought it through center and fed Leon with a nice one-timer.
He whiffed.
It turns out Leon had a broken rib and a broken finger.
So no shots on goal in Game 7.
Shocking.
Him and McDavid combined one assist in Game 6 and 7.
The first two playoff games of the entire playoffs in a row,
McDavid didn't have a point.
So it's like the timing's everything, and he wasn't able to get it done.
And you don't want to just put it on him but i'm sure for himself it was pretty hard after that game to
look at himself in the mirror and say oh i didn't have any points in that game because i for one
thought he'd light it up and i listened to 32 thoughts too but like it just seemed like with
what they'd put into the playoffs and i think they even talked about hyman and dry sidle as well just
running out of gas like what what mcdavid had to go through in order to even get his team to that level.
It's like, and then you're going against Barkov all night long.
And I know that maybe they got away from their game in games four through six,
but Sasha Barkov, still the best 200-foot center in the game.
He put the wet blanket on him.
And for McDavid, if you're not you don't have that full full gas tank loaded
it's just to get any type of separation not only from barkov but the way they play that five-man
game where they have layers on top of them it just it made his life a miserable hell and and and i i
can't remember other than the hyman opportunity and then maybe a few others where he really
shined in that game seven and a lot of
people were like you guys were just pumping the Oilers for 10 straight days it's like yeah dude
they won all three games I seem to remember games one through three we were pumping the Panthers
yeah my wrist and granted game one I was probably saying the Oilers outplayed them but like we were
saying how good Florida was games one through three and then it switched and then we were
talking about how good the Oilers were.
But in the end, game seven, it goes right back to Florida
and team defense and Sam fucking Reinhardt.
Awesome clip on the ice of Maurice kind of giving him a hug and saying,
dude, the rest of your life, you have the game-winning goal
in game seven of the Stanley Cup final.
Like, so cool.
The one thing I love about Reinhardt and Pasha kind of taught me
a little bit more about him that I didn't know
is one of the best defensive
players in the league.
So to score that many
goals and to get that big of a goal and still
be on the PK and so responsible
in your own end, that's why he's going to
sign eight years times what, nine and a half
you think? No, I think he's going to take a team
friendly deal and I think he's going to take nine million
now that they want to stay on the Cup well I think we should get Pasha on because
he was actually probably the one member of the podcast who didn't kick get kicked out of the
locker room and because he is so close with Sam Reinhart they've been buddies ever since they
were kids um you know he was able to kind of have a special night with him and you know his
you know him coming up I don't want to say the struggles in Buffalo, but I remember there's a video that just resurfaced
where he actually called the Buffalo Savers GM, Kevin Adams,
and he apologized for not getting the job done while he was in Buffalo.
So just Sam did right after he was traded,
and it just speaks to the volume of a guy that he is
and also his play this year and how fucking unreal he is as a player yeah i
mean i think everyone knows where my allegiances lie with the devils but seeing someone like sam
that i grew up with win a cup was obviously very special and emotional um guy deserved it he's a
warrior uh played his heart out and you know for him to score the cup winning goal like maurice
said it's it's a short list of guys that that have on their resume. So, yeah, it was really, really special to see him hoist that thing.
Pasha, when I was watching that game, and at first when he scored,
we were kind of like, oh, it's kind of a bad goal.
It's kind of outside.
But I was standing with a longtime NHL guy.
I don't know if he's Hall of Fame or not, but he's like, no, that's a good goal.
He's like, this Reinhardt kid has some weird release.
He doesn't release the puck the same way as the rest of the guys,
and it's really hard for the goalies to pick up.
Has he ever talked to you about that or anything?
No, I've never talked to him about his release.
I remember earlier this year I asked him about changing his stick
because you had asked me about that, and he said he changed up the stick length.
But, no, I haven't talked to him about his release in particular.
But, I mean, the guy can shoot it.
What did he have?
End of the year now, playoffs, regular season, 68
goals, something like that.
More than Buray. Just a crazy
year. Billy Zito, you've got
about four or five days to figure it out
and back up the Brinks truck because that man is
going to get paid. I thought the craziest thing
you mentioned to us was that you went back
to his house. It was about four in the morning. You guys
are hanging out with him and his wife, or you are.
And then all of a sudden he's like, I have a haircut at
10.30. Why did he need to get the
haircut at 10.30? He gotta look good for the
parade, boys. He already
looked good. His hair was short to begin with.
Whatever. I digress. But I want to go into the goal
because, yeah,
I would say Skinner wants that
one back. And Skinner was awesome. Dude, you gotta
remember, Skinner's second year in the NHL.
And what he did in games 4 through 7 of these series forget the beginning struggles like I have a lot
of belief in Stuart Skinner going forward as a goalie of the Edmonton Oilers and being able to
win a Stanley Cup with him I don't know if he'd he'd probably say he wants that goal back but I
was disappointed with how they played it it was like a three on three and they just kept backing
in and backing in and I think Reinhardt even was surprised he's like nobody's coming I mean he just gets that little angle
inside yeah good shot but it was more about how they played it and I believe it was right after
they had the chance in front that Kulikov barely saved I think it hit Kulikov and barely went wide
and then boom they go down the other end and 2-1 and And here's the craziest part about it. I saw a tweet.
I don't remember who sent it prior to the game that said,
if you averaged out, I think over the last five game sevens of the cup final,
if you averaged out when the winning goal was scored,
it was with five minutes left in the second period.
And you told me that with like, I don't know, 12 minutes left in the second.
I said to Basha and then boom, Reinhardt scores.
I'm like, fuck.
It was like 450-something.
450, and I was like, oh, my God.
Like, I think this could be it.
And it ended up being it.
And I love how the refs stayed out of that game.
I think there was a lot of complaining from Panthers fans' side
on the Kachuk penalty.
It was a bullshit call yeah i you're saying
you have to have control your body and if you play out like that it just looks so weird that
he happens to fall like right in front and with the amount of like shit kachuk has gotten from
fans and maybe refs for embellishment i think if that's anyone else they don't call it but they
look and see it's him, and he's so like,
what is the word, sly on the ice, is that the word?
Like he knows how to just draw calls and get in the mix,
and they're like, oh, that could have been on purpose.
It's Kachuk.
Probably not the best call, but overall,
the only power play the Oilers got, and Florida only had two.
Neither team scored, so I love that it was a five-on-five game,
and that's what anyone wanted going into that game, just the refs stay out stay out of it stay out and they did um I was just going to go back
to Pasha so you were able to spend time in that locker room like what was it like just watching
those guys soak it in because if there's one thing you could say about that that Panthers group is
majorly galvanized like they all love each other uh it doesn't matter who's getting taken out of
the lineup they don't care they just want their guy to get it done. So what was it like watching them all soak it in?
And were you in there when Barkov initially came in
and lifted the cup?
I wasn't in there when he first brought it in,
but I'll say probably my biggest takeaway was Maurice.
He went in there and gave a speech to the team
where right after I'm like,
no wonder these guys won the cup.
It was a crazy speech.
He was bringing up historical things. It was a crazy speech. He was bringing up historical things.
It was just, it was a motivating speech.
I can see why that group wanted to win for him.
You know, great to see a guy like him win.
But yeah, I mean, obviously vibes were very high in there.
And like I said, just very proud of Samson.
Well, I appreciate him bringing that up.
I think we should dive into Paul Maurice right now.
Because like his run, I mean, back-to-back trips to the Stanley Cup Finals.
This is coming after his resignation in Winnipeg.
He did mention Winnipeg Jets winning the Stanley Cup in his postgame presser,
one of them anyway.
I feel like he did eight interviews, and all of them were 10 out of 10.
One was on SVP.
SVP was awesome.
Which was unreal. SVP crushes it.
He's one of the best guys to interview guys,
especially right in the moment and extract everything he can out of them.
But I just thought the way that he took on a lot of the deflection from the team
and even when things weren't going so well,
when he was up there answering questions,
we were talking about Paul Maurice's quotes.
We weren't talking as much or maybe as much as that needed to be talked about
as maybe even some of the players play.
So what a run by Paul Maurice and a guy who probably one of the biggest coaches who deserved
the Stanley Cup with the time and energy he's put in the game and what he's given to the
game of hockey.
And becoming a coach that young, I apologize for my voice, becoming a coach that young
and then grinding and having a chance early on with Carolina against that wagon Detroit
team and then moving around and just never being able to get over the hump. And then you get up 3-0 and
boom, all of a sudden it's 3-3. It's like, am I like, is this going to happen? And he talked about
after the game that I think the day before game seven, he had the TV on and the banner on the TV
or whatever they were talking about. 15 minutes. 15 minutes it was up there mentioning, like,
will the Panthers become the biggest choke artist in sports history?
And he's like, move along, change the fucking band, for Christ's sake.
But what he's done has been magnificent.
And I've been told that in the locker room after the speech
had a lot to do with his father and where he got his name
and what his name means to him, which is so, like, awesome to hear.
Like, that's what your parents give you. Like, that's who you are is you may try to make your parents proud
and your kids proud which he's done and then after on the ice he spoke about his dad and
he you know he's getting teary-eyed saying like you know your legends how lindsey beliveau etc
like maurice is on the cup now with your favorite players.
Yeah, his father's name gets to be next to those legends,
and that's all he ever wanted.
And, wow, what a remarkable run from Paul Maurice.
I was also surprised.
Sorry, Mo, before you go.
I thought that last year when they were struggling,
when Keith Kachuk went on the radio and ripped him,
and then Maurice exploded against the Maple Leafs,
that was very much talked
about then this year when did he explode was that the playoffs or was that the end of the season
maybe another explosion on the bench late in the season late in the season I was wondering if he'd
end up having one in games four five or six not game four I think game four it's like all right
we got blown out we're going home but I thought maybe in game five or game six but he didn't
and you know that's
calculated and that's really like looking at it like I can't I can't turn on these guys now not
that he ever would but I can't I can't let them show that I'm as rattled as maybe I am inside
he had to have panic going into that game seven but the way he coached and the way he had them
prepared including having Bobrovsky not practice that day. It was a masterclass. I think him and Knobloch were both phenomenal the whole run.
Unbelievable.
Was something said about what he talked to the team about in those two days off,
which I thought was huge for the Florida Panthers coming home.
Was there anything that he said to the team?
I know he gave Bobrovsky the day away from the rink in order to collect his
mind and thoughts, but I'd be curious to know, like you said,
he didn't pull that card
because you can only pull that card so many times by snapping on the boys you can't lose the team
and and show frustration and that you're rattled going into game seven after dropping the last
three i don't know what what he did in order to get them with that demeanor to get them back to
their game in game seven yeah he was incredible for two years now. Paul Maurice and Prefs conferences have been like the best combination.
It's like John Cooper-esque.
Lots of things are better together, Biz.
Hockey, food, golf.

After the night in Fort Lauderdale, we were on a Stanley Cup finder.
We couldn't find that thing anywhere.
We were chasing it around all Fort Lauderdale.
We never got it, but the close-up on
Paul Murray's never been happier for a coach to win
a cup. 5-0 in Game 7
now. Also, most games coached before
winning his first Stanley Cup, 1985
games. Is that playoffs included?
Playoffs included, yeah.
Also, we failed to mention that
Conor McDavid won the Conn's Mike Trophy as well. I know he
probably doesn't give a shit. He had eight goals,
34 assists in 25 games.
Just a tremendous performance.
I'm sure I'm busy that he'd give it back to have a freaking Stanley Cup, no doubt.
Yeah, I mean, people wanted to argue a little bit about the fact that it's,
what is it, the first ever guy to get a Conn Smythe
who didn't have a point in game six and seven or something?
Yes, I think the first stat I saw that I was telling you was incorrect.
But I understand it.
It's not about the most valuable player in the finals
or game six and seven of the finals.
It's the entire playoffs.
And I wouldn't have given it to Bobrovsky after what happened in four,
five, and six.
But I would have been fine with Barkov.
But I do think that McDavid did deserve it.
It's just unfortunate's it's unfortunate and
for anyone out there for anyone who was like on him for not coming back on the ice and accepting
the trophy you oh they're saying oh Jaeger did it who gives a fuck yeah and Jaeger like regretted
having to do that he said it was horrible he walked back in the locker room put it down right
when he got off the ice and just went back in the room didn't tell anyone like why do you have to come back out it's the same people who were dogging royal rory mcelroy for
taking off after the u.s open collapse and not doing media it's like buddy this is this guy's
entire life he cares more about this than you've maybe cared about anything minus your kids and he
doesn't want to go back out and accept a trophy that means nothing to him right maybe someday
it will mean something to him if he wins a cup,
but you're under no obligation to go back on the ice and accept that trophy.
That's just bullshit to me that people upset.
And also 20 more points to the next guy, right?
Yeah, it's like at some point you break a Gretzky record.
Well, at least on the Panthers, excuse me.
I don't think, and I think Elliot touched on it in 32 Thoughts,
nobody on the Panthers did excuse me. I don't think, and I think Elliot touched on it in 32 Thoughts, nobody on the Panthers did something so exceptional in the final
to take it away from them, and that's ultimately why I think
Connor McDavid got it.
So congrats to him.
I know it doesn't mean jack shit to him.
He wanted the ultimate prize.
But going back to the Panthers, I mean, do you guys want to talk
Bill Zito, Luongo?
How about Luongo before the game?
Banging the drum. Banging the drum.
Banging the drum, getting the boys going on the jumbotron.
Like this guy's in management, he's fired up, getting all the crowd into it,
and the energy was so high in the building.
Did you guys like that move to get him going?
Oh, yeah, he's a beloved icon down there too.
But I want to mention Kyle Oposo first.
I mean, this guy before this season had 17  I'm sorry, 24 playoff games before this season,
played 17 playoff games this season, almost doubled his previous career
output. He's a guy who's been around for a long
time. Just want to give him a congratulations. Want to mention
him. Hopefully we get him on the show going forward.
He was talking about playing mini sticks with this kid
the day before, trying to take the stress away.
He didn't play Game 6.
He looked great, too,
in Game 7. He had that jump early.
I noticed him a lot.
They were hitting everything in that first period.
They were hitting everything, and I love Maurice putting him back in.
Like, this is a guy who's done it all.
This could be it for him.
You never know.
And let's get him back in the mix.
He's already played 16 games for us in the playoffs.
We didn't have him in.
We need this guy who wants this so bad, who's had no success in the playoffs prior in his career,
and they put him back in and he did his job.
Merle said it right from the hop.
He did a great job.
Their third and fourth line was awesome.
And I think that Ocposo, after coming on with us
and talking about his concussion and what he had to go through
and the pain he had trying to get back
and not knowing if he'd ever play again,
those are the stories that just, as a former player, for me, it makes me teary-eyed like this guy thought it was all over this guy went
through so many bad teams in Buffalo he was a great leader in Buffalo and you talk to the guys
there and they're so thankful that they had him as a captain and then he gets the chance at the
deadline to go to a contender and then he's in and out of the lineup it gets thrown in in game seven
you're like that's what that's what sports is about, man.
You worked your entire life,
and you ended up winning that greatest trophy in sport with your entire family there.
I was so happy for him.
Another incredible move at the deadline by Bill Zito.
And it goes back.
I mean, let's look at the Kachuk move.
That was the first time we'd ever seen a sign-in trade like that.
And you establish your culture even more than what they'd had.
Verhege had won a cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning.
And Bill Zito, his first year, I think he signed in 2020.
So he's been in the organization for four years.
They bring over Verhege.
They got Reinhardt.
You talked about Rodriguez replenishing that back end.
Sam Bennett.
The list goes on of crazy moves that he's made
to make this team a winner, and that cannot be overlooked.
This guy has been absolute rock solid in his four years so far.
And then also signing Paul Maurice.
The list goes on and on, bringing in Roberto Luongo.
So just the organization as a whole and the moves they've made
in order to put these guys in place to win a championship,
it should be studied in the fact that they pulled this off.
And he's the fifth GM in history to win a Calder Cup as a GM
and a Stanley Cup as a GM.
So he's worked his way up.
He was an agent.
Merle, you know him well.
Yeah, I've known him for like 25 years.
He was an agent, and he had Ray Drew and Jeff Hamilton,
kind of like not big-name guys.
And he was really big in Finland.
So he was going over to Finland.
He could always get guys jobs in Finland.
He started bringing over some Finnish younger players and getting them in.
And then he went in to Columbus, right?
There's assistant GM with the,
with the Finnish GM there and just started learning more and more and more
about the business.
And he is just dialed in.
He is not afraid to make moves.
Remember how mad we were at him at the beginning for some moves he was doing?
Yeah, I mean, I was very hard on him,
and I'm not going to hide the fact that what he did to Keith Yandel,
I don't agree with.
I think it was proven that with teammates going in and saying,
you can't do this, and then him not being scratched, that was part of it.
Panthers fans have always been all over me because I've said they won't win the Cup.
I'm now saying, amazing team.
You guys deserved it.
Bill Zito, yeah, at the beginning, I'm like, this guy's a clown.
But, dude, he did not give a shit.
The Kachuk deal was a big one, and he does not really care at all what anyone else says or thinks about him,
which is exactly how you have to be in this business.
Look at R.A. for fuck's sake. And I think for him to be able to just have the panic and the anger
and the water bottle throw and then be able after to just release it all.
You saw him.
He's an emotional guy.
Ray Ferraro said he was crying for 30 minutes on the ice.
Buddy, I would be bawling still if I won the Stanley Cup.
So I get it, and I'm very happy for the entire team.
I mean, I look at Oliver Ekman-Larsen too,
and when they lost Stahl and Gutis
and they brought in Oliver Ekman-Larsen and Mikula,
you can't tell me that part of it wasn't seeing the size of the Vegas D,
the Murley theory.
And yes, Mark Stahl was very big, but Gutis is undersized,
even though he plays like he's 6'7".
But all right, I don't care.
I'm getting two big guys in here.
And Oliver Ekman-Larsen was chirped nonstop in Vancouver.
You remember the clip of him in training camp.
He was about eight miles behind guys on a bag skate.
Everyone's all over him.
He gets bought out.
And being bought out is probably one of the worst feelings you can have as a professional athlete.
It's just straight up, we are going to pay you to not be on this team if you
look at it like how it is it's it's it's a slap in the face and how you're going to respond to that
and oliver eckman larson he went to work this summer he lost a little weight i believe he
worked on his power skating and he looked awesome he took over the first power play role when monto
was struggling so just amazing move after amazing move and guys
really just digging deep and not not at all thinking about the outside noise until chicklets
came around and all of a sudden they all despised us but so be it it was it was an amazing game and
to have the panic of possibly losing that game and then playing as well as they did that's what
i was impressed about just going back to all ofckman larson too like yeah like tons of scrutiny obviously being in a canadian media
market like vancouver um i heard rumblings that they were going to try to make it work because
he had a conversation with talk and the fact that he was going to really dig in and have a big off
season and then obviously the buyout did end up coming and when you've made as much money as that
sometimes it's easy to say, yeah, you know what?
It was a great career.
I accomplished a lot.
And then here we go all right off into the sunset.
But he went back home this summer and put in so much fucking work,
not only on his power skating, his skill work, getting back on the gym.
You said he lost a little bit of weight.
That has to do with the muscle that he gained because he played with that
snarl all
season long and including playoffs where i'd never really seen him play with that type of mean streak
it was always that offensive dispensement so for him part of being on florida it's just like
osmosis obviously to buy into that but the fact that after you know suffering that embarrassment
to take a look in the mirror and address it in the off season and come with that working mentality to Florida and put it in, put in the work that he did.
I couldn't be happier for the guy because he's a 10 out of 10 human being who had just been
stripped of a constant confidence, but he put the work in to regain it. So it's a lesson to be
learned for anybody who might not be where they were. You put in the work and eventually he's
going to turn back around. So love you O OEL, and hopefully we're able to interview you
about the last 12 months of your life, and how about a fucking turnaround?
Absolutely.
Merle, just to piggyback on your Finland point there,
Barkov became the first Finland-born captain to win the Stanley Cup.
He had 22 points in 24 games, but then he shut down Kutrov,
shut down Pasta, shut down the two guys at Edmonton, just a stellar job.
Also, the Oilers have been eliminated by the eventual cup champ for the third straight season.
So that that leads me into Edmonton.
And you you like to believe and you like to look at like the people who didn't need to lose a final before they won one.
And there are many out there. Mario Lemieux never lost a final before he won one.
You know, it happens. But there's something to be said about Gretzky's legendary story of seeing the Islanders and realizing like
it just takes a little bit more. And Edmonton, they got behind the ball. It was 0-3. Like you
can't, yes, they won three in a row, but four in a row, it's just nearly impossible. But Edmonton,
I believe, and a lot will come down to Leon and his decision. He did press conference today where
he said, I love being an Edmonton oil decision. He did press conference today where he said,
I love being an Edmonton Oiler.
I haven't really thought about it yet,
but I love more than anything being an Edmonton Oiler.
I think he will resign.
I don't know if it'll be an eight-year deal.
It could be one of those shorter deals.
You see Matthews.
He sees some of these great players now.
Maybe he'll look to sign something until the CBA ends.
I don't know.
He has no intention of signing a short-term deal,
and he's looking for a long-term extension.
Okay, well, hopefully it's in Edmonton.
Hopefully it's in Edmonton, because if he is back in Edmonton,
and if Conor stays as an Edmonton Oiler, they will get a Stanley Cup.
You could call me crazy.
The way Evan Bouchard has turned into a legit star defenseman in the NHL.
Amazing shot.
Amazing poise with the puck.
You got Ekholm signed.
Now, they have a lot of guys they do have to re-sign.
I think Yan marks up for a new deal.
I think Connor Brown is a no-brainer.
If he wants to stay there, you do whatever it takes.
And it's not going to be big money based on his stats.
You need the stats in the regular season to get the big dough.
No matter how good he was in the playoffs, he didn't have the big numbers
so hopefully they can get him locked up
and you have things there and you have that
loss in the finals to drive you
and get you back there. And losing three years
in a row to the Cup winners,
it just shows they are so close.
One game away, one period away
but it's also so difficult to get there.
They played some amazing
hockey. Down 3-2 to Vancouver, down 2-1 to Dallas,
and then you realize next year, Dallas is going to be better.
Colorado might be better.
Vegas is going to be back in the mix.
Vancouver had a great season.
So it's like, it's very scary as an Oilers fan
to look at how difficult it is to get there,
but I believe they'll be able to do it based on those two guys.
That's the biggest kick of the dick,
and Dreisaitl, touch on it.
You're two shots away from accomplishing your goal,
and now you have to hit the reset button, go through a whole 82-game season.
And if you could look at the  probably the biggest bright spot for me
is the way that Broberg was able to come in and play the way he did.
His skating ability, guys, is out of this world.
There was a few times in that game seven where he had the puck
and he'd gotten it below the goal line,
and he just moved his hips a certain way,
and next thing you know, he was at the top of the circle.
Do that again.
I did like this.
A little crotch shot for you guys watching the live stream right now.
But his ability to move out there, it's kind of like Makar-esque.
He's not at that level, but it ain't that far off.
So the fact that you have him,
I believe,
one more year
on an entry-level deal,
it kind of offsets the money
that Darnell Nurse is making, right?
So that to me
is probably the biggest positive
where that back end
will look very similar
and if not,
get a little bit better
because he's never played
a full season in the NHL.
And I was told
that Paul Coffey has said,
give me a season with this kid,
he's going to be an all-star.
Well, there you go. And I trust that. Paul Coffey has said, give me a season with this kid. He's going to be an all-star. Well, there you go.
And I trust that. I think being that big and skating that well, 22
years old, they got a great one in him. And it was
amazing to see how he played, being hopped in,
being thrown in, and then minors
most of the year. Forget looking
out of place. There were times he dominated,
carrying the puck up ice with his legs
and his speed. So it's just
heartbreaking. I feel so bad for Oilers fans.
And I know much of Canada maybe didn't want the Oilers,
but I feel bad for Canada too.
I think and I want Canada to get a Stanley Cup.
We saw that city.
We saw how alive it was.
What was really cool was I mentioned Brad Tuchek a lot.
We played golf with him.
He was talking to me about how much money the city made in that run.
250 million probably by the time it's all said and done and and growth financially really
for the city of edmonton i think that like in the finals at some point it just reached over
200 million so for a small community like that like i'd never spend that much time in edmonton
we were in and out for for when i played in the nhl and NHL and I popped in a few times during that Pink Whitney tour
but just an amazing
city with amazing people
and I guess that's probably why R.A. went over the top
rails and starting to root for him
is just because of the way that they were babysitting him
the whole time. He was crippled.
Did you not have a
friend that you'd met there throughout the finals
that basically carried you
all the way to Florida? Yeah, the girl.
The girl who let you run over.
She had him in a wheelchair at the airport.
Not quite that, but yeah, she was
helping me out. She became a new pal.
Obviously, you've known her for a little while.
You met her prior to this. Yeah, I know her and her friend
group, and then all of a sudden, I'm like,
I said, the night before,
you were hanging out with some crackhead, and I'm like, oh my god sudden I'm like oh I I said like the night before you were hanging out with some crackhead
and I'm like oh my god I'm like
he's with the crackhead
and they're flying together and all of a sudden it's like
no no it's this girl and I'm like oh okay so
now he's got a new one he's ditched Kate
Kate's on the back burner he had a crackhead
girlfriend and now he's got this new Asian
one so you have just been tasting the
whole buffet RA I'll tell ya
I'll figure it out blue eyes
oh yeah I forgot about the hottest one of them all but uh yeah so i don't know what what
more you have to touch on as far as the edmonton oilers but uh incredible job by knob block coming
in part way through the season and and uh really figuring out this team and his calm demeanor had
a major major impact and influence on how they were able to respond come playoff time.
And you look back at all the changes he made to the lineup,
and I think we talked about it last pod.
It's like everything he touched turned to gold as far as decision-making,
and they fall a goal short, guys.
I don't know.
And remember Bouchard hit the post.
Remember third period Bouchard hit the post.
They had that power play, the only one they had.
What's his name?
Stenland broke his stick, had to give his stick. I'm name? Stenland broke his stick, had to give his stick.
I'm sorry, Forslund broke his stick, had to give his.
So they basically had a five and three and a half for that whole power play,
and they couldn't do anything with it.
They scored an opportunity right there.
Yeah, I think that Broberg was a huge add.
Like, he's only going to get better.
He had to live in the hotel during playoffs.
He'll have to get an apartment next year.
He'll be even better.
But what are you looking for next year from the Oilers?
A draft pick or free agency? Anything
really glaring you want to add?
We can go to the fact that
Rumormill is going around, that Ken Holland
is out. I've heard rumblings
that a
former GM of the Chicago Blackhawks
might be taking over there, so
there is just a lot going on.
I thought that Stan Bowman and
Quenville were banned right now.
I didn't say a name.
You did.
Well, you said the Chicago Blackhawks.
That's right.
I said a former.
Oh, wait.
I said a former.
I'm hearing rumblings that a former GM of the Chicago Blackhawks
has taken over.
That's it.
I heard rumblings.
Have all you guys heard rumblings?
I think Scotty Uppi.
No, it's Uppi.
Yeah, Buddy Uppi said,
source telling me that Ken Holland could be on his way to Chicago.
Blackhawks' position to be determined.
Could this be the beginning of building a new dynasty in Chicago?
They have the cap space and draft picks.
See how it plays out.
So Uppi doesn't really throw stuff out there like that.
No, he never does.
I'm sure there's probably something to it.
Never does.
I'd heard that like a week ago.
I just didn't really want to break it,
like the fact that he wasn't coming back
and the fact that who he would be replaced with.
But I like to see things play out.
I'm not really the journo newsbreaker guy.
The only scary thing about the Oilers is like,
you know, you talk about Gretzky and he lost the cup final
and then they went on the run and McDavid's now lost one.
But I think it was Gretzky's fourth year that they lost
and fifth year they won.
It's McDavid's, what, ninth?
Yeah.
So it's like you look at, like, holy shit, it just time goes so fast.
Parents out there know it's just, like, long days, short years,
and all of a sudden Connor McDavid's going into his 10th season,
11th season, whatever it is.
It's like you just start thinking about, will this guy ever get one?
And I believe he will, but it's just so fucking hard to win a Stanley cup. And you saw it in person on game seven and the sacrifices
that Florida made and how long of a run it is too. It's exhausting. It's what is it? June 25th.
It's a hundred degrees out. Like how are they still playing hockey? And they were so close. So
I, this summer, I mean, I don't know. I i think you really really look at brown and yanmark and
you're looking at the third line and there's just not any money to bring in a stud you know you'd
have to make a big deal i don't know what they're going to do with nurse but if there were rumblings
that they would try to get rid of nurse after they went down 3-0 and then maybe it changes after like
the little comeback like i don't that doesn't make sense to me you can't let like three games and
tying the series up affect how you're going to approach free agency
and the trades and all that.
But it's just, obviously, they got to get a guy in there first
that's going to make the decisions
because Ken Holland apparently won't even be here at the draft.
No, obviously, he's going to be switching jobs.
We got to talk about the ratings too, Biz.
The second highest rated Stanley Cup in North America
since 2013 when Chicago played Boston way back in the day.
Just the numbers, absolutely.
16.3 million viewers across North America.
I know Canada, everyone up there is watching,
but these numbers are unreal business now that you're in the TV business.
Do you hear anything from your peers?
Guys, we've been talking about all season long,
like hockey is on a heater right now.
I think that it is going to take over and leapfrog other major sports.
Maybe not the NBA, maybe not the NFL, but definitely, in my opinion,
the MLB with the way that the introduction of the NHL,
more teams coming in, expansion, the parity, the skill set,
and the development of the players alone to me.
I forget what year I retired.
I think it was 2016 or 2017.
But I was playing in the AHL, and I'm like,
these fucking kids are so fast now.
They're twice the speed of when I came in.
And to now, when you go down close to the ice,
if you're sitting in the lower bowl, you're like,
how the fuck did I even ever play in this league?
No, we didn't.
We didn't.
It was a different league.
Oh, it was.
People say you played in the NHL.
I go, not this NHL.l yeah the version 1.0 and in game seven like we were saying in the box like there
was no time and space zero and this is after playing 25 games or whatever in the playoffs like
you just have no room out there because people are so big and fast that the talent and the plays
that are made now i get the TV ratings being this high.
I believe it was the most watched game in the history of the NHL in Canada.
Yeah.
And it's just awesome to see.
And I know Bettman's taken a lot of heat over the years, guys,
but the whole league in general is heading in the right direction.
They're making the right moves.
Hey, Bissonnette, you ever been sober?
That was what Gary said to me.
Was it game six or game seven?
I don't know. I wasn't there for it, but
then you're getting after it tonight, Gary.
Our interactions with Gary this tournament
have been unbelievable. We might get him
on the pod. I think he's warming up to us enough.
That was hilarious. Maybe we had
him. I don't know. We might
not even get credentials now with R.A.'s
episode on the ice, but it's just awesome
to see you guys, and it's the testament to everybody
involved, like all the other media outlets who do work obviously tnt esbn sports net ttsn and even
like the the journalists the the people who travel around and amazon coming on amazon's coming on
they're doing this behind the behind the scenes doc on what is it 12 players i've actually been
doing some voiceover for it to help out with
it and it's just like i i shook everybody's hand yesterday after i did it i said they're like thank
you i said no thank you like everything you guys are doing to help grow the game is huge more
eyeballs means everybody wins and this great game deserves it based on the time and effort
and and how competitive and how much these guys love and put into their sport so even everybody
watching right now we thank you guys we know how invested you guys love and put into their sport. So even everybody watching right now, we thank you guys.
We know how invested you guys are.
Like Whit just said, we're at the fucking end of June,
and you guys are watching hockey.
So it's incredible to see, and I'm so proud of the league
and all the work of the people behind the scenes that they've done
to get it to where it is right now.
I was kind of surprised the parade isn't until Sunday.
That's quite a long time.
I actually like that.
Let all this stuff get over with, and then once everything settles down,
they can actually really, really take it in,
and it gives people enough time to organize to actually show up in South Florida
and put out those numbers.
My prediction is they get more fans in the Miami Heat
after that pathetic parade they had a few years ago.
Did they mention the route or anything yet?
Is it going to go right?
Oh, it's going right by the elbow.
818 Beachfront Avenue. All right. parade they had a few years ago. Did they mention the route or anything yet? Is it going to go right? Oh, it's going right by the elbow. Oh, yeah.
818 Beachfront Avenue.
All right.
We haven't really talked about, like, so Pasha mentioned how he ended up at Sam Reinhardt's house at about 3, 3.30.
They spent all their time partying in the locker room.
And most teams, sometimes they have a big party set up or they go out to like, you know,
go out to the club.
But they all went home after the locker room situation,
and then right early in the morning, everybody was at the elbow room,
and that's the way you even said it too.
I would have loved to have done it.
The day partying is the best part, so Kachuk gets to get there early.
He's pouring beer, and the few people that are there early enough to get it,
and then he brings it over for a dip in the ocean,
and then all the local news outlets had already posted all about it,
and then Elbow Room was packed.
It was packed inside.
It looked like there was probably about 500 to 1,000 people outside,
and the city really got to embrace it at Matthew and Walt Kachuk's favorite bar,
which is the Elbow Room.
They went swimming in the ocean with it too.
Yeah, I think I just mentioned that unless I'm going fucking crazy.
Did I mention that?
You did, you did. You're going crazy. No, shout out to G. You're playing clean up. I love going fucking crazy. Did I mention that? You did.
You're going crazy.
No, shout out to Jay.
Gee, you're playing clean up.
I love you, brother.
So I was at the elbow room.
We were chasing the cup.
Me and Memes, the Empty Netter boys, we were like, we got to see the cup.
We want to try to drink out of this thing tonight.
And so the elbow room closes at 2.
But we start leaving.
Some guy grabs us like, no, no, no.
You guys can go upstairs.
Go up there with Mark Messier and PK and Steve Levy, all those guys.
They said, the Cubs coming.
Cubs coming here.
Everybody else is getting kicked out.
We're going to go up to the second floor.
Because on the second floor, they don't have the live stream cameras either.
Oh, I was getting posts about me playing tummy sticks with a few ladies on the live stream camera.
So we sat there.
We waited there from like two to three.
Still no shows.
See R.A. out in the middle, A1A, throwing drinks at people.
Yeah, so let's get into that.
What happened, R.A.?
It was a wild night.
It was great, but we never got eyes on the cup.
Wait, you got in a Donny burn?
I almost twice.
I almost squared up twice the other night.
I haven't had a fight since 1988.
Square up?
Yeah, yeah.
Like fucking...
Yeah, I know, But what was the reason?
You would have got dribbled, dude.
I don't know.
I was pretty fucking irate the other night.
You know, that fucking Superman strength.
It's called coke strength, though.
It's called coke strength.
Some guy has the video of it.
He came up to me at the elbow room and was showing me the video of it.
And then I didn't want to give him my number.
I don't know why.
It was whatever panic I was in.
But I was like, I was trying to video record his phone with the ra drink toss but it never
worked out but the video's out there if you're listening send it to g i don't even know if i
just got the cap so i don't even unless it was another guy i don't know no the first guy got
the cabin i don't even know what the interaction was but fucking like i i wasn't the one back
pedaling i'll fucking leave it at that.
Not like today, not like
at the elbow room. Now, do we have a few
other of the RA interactions
on the ice, if we could go back to it?
I believe you talked to Lamborghini,
who is a fan favorite.
I don't know if you guys at home saw
him in the locker room with a tarp off.
Just a little speedo
underwear.
He's got all those, like, what is that thing they do?
The back muscles?
The cupping.
Oh, yeah.
He's got all those, like, circles all over him.
He's jacked.
But, yeah, I mean, he was like, fuck biz, fuck wit.
I got a kick out of that.
What else did I want to say about that night?
I don't know if you want to do the part two or the second almost fight.
The first one, whatever.
So, the second one, there's the pizza joint next door, right? To the elbow room.
There's all people, they're waiting for food.
I wanted to buy a couple drinks.
I was seeing if I could pay for my drinks enough to wait for everyone to get their fucking food to buy a couple drinks.
And some kid got fucking mouthy, right?
Hilarious. He had a Red Sox hat on.
Starts pointing to the B on his hat like he's fucking
Doug McRae from the town, not some goofball from
Londonderry, New Hampshire. Tells people he's 20 minutes from Boston.
Fucking stayed in line.
I was fucking angry. I was heated after what just
happened. What do you want to do, kid?
He stayed in line.
Pointing his hat to the beat like I was going to be scared of him.
It was pour over from
your anger from the
locker room situation. You were carrying
it with you. A big bag of emotion. You've been with me a long
time. Have I ever lost my fucking
cool? Maybe once if I can't remember.
Pasha, when he was recording,
you puked him before we started here.
He doesn't record me puking. He walks in the bathroom when the dough is shot.
Pasha's been
wearing a Boston Red Sox hat.
Was it him?
Will you call Keith Kachuk?
I told you yesterday I might, but
I don't think there's anything for me to call.
I don't owe anybody an apology.
We need to settle it on the pod.
We want to get Matthew and Walt on.
Just an incredible run.
Those guys deserve it.
We didn't really talk about the moment that he had with Brady as well.
We're a year removed from Brady having to put his clothes on for him going to the rink
in order to try to even play with that broken sternum.
Checking to make sure he's breathing.
Yeah, so just an incredible moment to share with his brother
who should be hopefully in the playoffs soon enough,
if not on the Florida Panthers at some point,
because we're missing out with not getting Brady Kachuk come playoff time.
But just a great moment for him and his family.
And like I said, the invites out there.
We want to get any Panthers, whether you guys are willing, even though we're
Oilers' jock sniffers.
Also, one last thing on the cup, unless you guys have anything
else. Alanis Mara said absolutely
croakbow to those anthems. She was unbelievable.
Yeah, but the... I thought she
stopped singing. Well, the crowd took over the
first one where it was off-tune
because the crowd was like,
no, no, no, we got this one, and then took it off.
Yeah, so, great job. She showed out all the Oil this one, and then took it off. Yeah, so great job.
She showed out all the Oilers fans too.
I believe somebody said 9,000 people flew down from Edmonton.
I don't know if that's legit, but it was Oilers fans everywhere.
And once in a lifetime chance to see your team play for the Stanley Cup,
pretty cool the travel, how difficult that was,
that that many people made it down to Florida for that game.
Absolutely, boy.
So that's it.
Any final thoughts, Merrill?
So we're good to go.
No, an amazing playoffs again.
I mean, this every year seems more and more fun for us
and better and better hockey coverage.
And, I mean, it's just all been positive going around all these places,
seeing these games, and looking forward to starting next season already.
Absolutely.
It's been an epic run.
But, boys, today we're talking about Kraken, one of the OG crypto platforms. These guys have been around way longer than the

Boy, epic cup run.
Epic cup run.
Five games you went to, man.
What a ripper.
But some other major news that dropped.
Hockey Hall of Fame rolls.
Got seven new members coming in here.
Detroit Red Wing legend, Pavel Datsyuk,
one of the best defensemen of his era, Shea Weber.
Jeremy Roenick finally gets in.
U.S. women's players, Natalie Dowitz and Chrissy Wendell-Pole
will go to his players, while longtime GM David Poyle
and league exec Colin Campbell will go in the build-up category.
I tell you what, it just makes me feel really old
when there's guys that I played against and they're going into the Hall of Fame.
But is Shea Weber, I thought he was still on the books with Phoenix.
Isn't he the only guy on Utah?
Yeah, he's my D partner.
Yeah, but I think they altered that rule a few years back
when guys are obviously not going to come back,
even if their salary is still active.
They're going to let them get in the Hall of Fame,
which makes a lot of sense, you know,
especially if these guys run extended deals.
Whit, what was your reaction to the Hall of Fame election?
So happy for JR.
We actually talked to him at our sandbagger in San Diego
when we got our asses kicked by him and Timu.
And Timu was even saying this guy.
You think the sandbagger was what did it?
Maybe, possibly.
I think that Timu was so adamant about J.R.,
you should be in the Hall of Fame.
This is bullshit.
Like hearing him say that, you know,
I knew there was some chance that he would get in.
I'm glad for him.
Pavel Datsyuk, one of the biggest no-brainers maybe that I can think of.
Shea Weber, in my mind, can think of. Shea Weber.
In my mind, I think of Shea Weber.
I think of a Hall of Famer. A little surprised
first time, first ballot
Hall of Famer. I thought maybe he might have to
wait, considering, you know,
we've seen some other names have to wait a little bit, but
he's a Hall of Famer. The way he changed games,
the way he was so dominant. Big,
strong, physical defense with a rocket
Weber bomb. Remember that? Weberman with a rocket. Weber bomb.
Remember that?
Weber bomb.
Here comes a Weber bomb.
So I like it.
I love it.
I want some more of it.
So Weber's in.
He should be in.
It's just a Mogilny issue for me.
So every single year we go over this.
I don't understand it.
I don't get it.
It better happen.
And you know what?
I think a lot of people thought JR would never get in,
so that makes me think Mogilny will. but Mogilny is a hall of famer. You think of Alexander Mogilny and what he did in the league, you think a hall of fame in my opinion.
So hopefully he ends up getting in. What names am I forgetting? A couple of women.
Walt Kachuk isn't in, I know. No, isn't in. I thought you meant guys who should get in.
No, the people who got in. This performance by him after the game
shoving R.A. out of there might get him over.
How hated R.A. is
right now. Them voters might get him right in.
He's still American, so I don't know about that.
David Poyle
and Colin Campbell, two of the other names.
Okay, makes sense to me.
I mean, David Poyle, fucking
A, dude. That guy did it for a long time.
He had a small market team in Nashville be competitive quite often.
He did a great job.
Incredible drafter, especially of defensemen.
God damn.
Dan Hamheiss, Ham Heuss, I always mess that up.
Weber, Suter, it was just like Eckholm.
It was just Ryan Ellis.
He was just always bringing in stud defensemen,
and I think that he's well-deserved there.
Colin Campbell, I know Greg Campbell very well.
Awesome guy, Stanley Cup champion.
I don't know his dad that well.
But he's been around the league for so long.
And I love seeing people get in the Hall of Fame.
I'm not somebody who's going to sit there at a name and say,
what the fuck, he should have never got in.
Because if you're even up for it, you're that great of a player.
You've had that great of a career that if you get in, great for you.
I don't have a vote in it.
So, if you're in, I'm just happy for you because as Biz has made it quite clear,
he'd let in anyone.
Merles would be in the Hall of Fame if it was up to Biz.
Oh, 100.
Yeah, and Adalitz and Wendell Paul, they play for you.
R.A. would be for journalist.
Yeah, journalist of the year.
They do have that one.
Drunkest journalist in the history of hockey.
His picture would have
the choke collar. I think
it might have actually been a headband biz, not an
actual choker. Oh, I know.
Someone picked it up off the bus. But you made it a choker.
You told me to keep it on, buddy.
I was listening to my man.
I would mention the two women, Dowitz, Wendell Paul.
They played for the U.S. women's team.
Played in the 2002 and 2006 Olympic teams back then.
Won a silver and bronze, respectively. Boys, lots of news went on the last.S. women's team, played in the 2002 and 2006 Olympic teams back then, won a silver and bronze respectively.
Boys, lots of news went on the last couple of days.
Elliot mentioned, as you were telling me, he said it might be one of the crazier weeks we've ever had.
I think it might have been G or Pasha who said it, but I read the tweet too,
and I was excited when I saw it.
We talk about it all the time, guys, with the hard cap and the fact that, yeah, it moved up 4 million.
That's not a crazy amount given what you have.
But the 4 million next year, so knowing that, it does change it.
So you know in two years you got 8 million more.
Sure.
I think that that probably allows people to make some more moves
than maybe usually.
Yeah, and I also think that people are looking at how aggressive
Bill Zito with what he did and the moves that he made and saying, you know, we're a few moves away.
Let's get aggressive here.
So I know the all-mark one went down, and there's some other crazy ones.
So I just think that, once again, with everything and where their league's at
and the fact that it's on a heater, all these crazy moves happening in the offense
or the offseason, excuse me, to keep the momentum going is just what the game game needs and i don't know if we're going to dive into that all mark one right
now but if you're a bees fan holy fuck you must be losing your mind right now you have one of the
best surprise you have a you have a guy who's who's a season removed from winning a vesna
and he's getting a fucking 25th overall first round pick pick, a late first-round pick. Corpozalo, and I believe there's a prospect.
Corpozalo was one of the worst statistical goalies
in the NHL last year.
Yeah, but dude, come on.
Things can change quick.
He's a very athletic guy,
and Ottawa's not the easiest team to play for
because they give up a lot of great A's.
I think he also led the league in amount of goals
he led up on the first shot of the game this season.
So a reset will be good for him going into a team like Boston who has great structure.
But to me, it's just like Ottawa had to get him off the books.
Like he makes 3 million, not much less than what Allmark makes.
So a 25th in return to me is just lunacy.
I thought the Bruins had a great opportunity with Allmark
to bring in a player who could really help them.
That's what I'm saying.
And it's like, oh my God, you have Swayman.
Now you can get another player with Allmark.
You need centers.
And boom, you're like, wait, what?
We didn't even get anyone to help up front?
Who is the other player involved?
There was one Mark Kosellick.
He's a bottom six center at that.
And they have six of those at this point.
And people forget, they have the best goalie in the AHL right now,
Brandon Bussey.
So they have homegrown talent.
They have Michael DiPietro as well.
I thought it was like in Calgary that was the best goalie.
Either way, he's good.
He's unbelievable.
And they just re-signed him to a three-year deal,
so it doesn't make any sense why they would make that.
And they've retained 25.
But still, it's like, if you want to get rid of Corpozalo now,
you have to attach an asset to it.
Do you know it?
That's kind of where I was going, where if anything,
that should have been, you should be getting something
for taking him based on the season he had
and the fact that you have to get him off the book.
So very, a big head scratcher.
We'll see.
Normally I'm okay with a lot of the moves that the Bs make,
but this one just didn't feel like the right thing this this goes back to the power and the leverage and him just deciding he
didn't want that trade to go down at the deadline whatever they had built up I believe somebody said
it was to LA and he said no and when a player has the ability to say no it's like you're hamstrung
a little bit and they didn't they let's go ahead oh sorry what I mean you don't you don't want to
go to LA but you're going to Ottawa? I know.
I don't get that.
Just to let people know the trade, they traded Linus Omak to Ottawa for goalie.
You notice Korpisalo, Mark Kostelic in the first.
You mentioned this weekend, the 25th overall.
Omak, he's only got one more year left on the deal at 5 mil.
I think that was probably a factor on the return.
Korpisalo has four more years left at a 4 million AAV.
The Sens are retaining 25 of that.
Kostelic, one more year at 835K.
Listen, Omak was
hardly a number one goalie when the Bruins brought him in.
A lot of people were shaking their heads
when the Bruins brought him in, right? Coming from Buffalo,
he wasn't really an established number one goalie.
System goalie? I'm not calling him a system
goalie at all, but I'm saying he's your number one
goalie. Korpisalo was a pretty damn good
goalie in Columbus. Things didn't work out in Ottawa.
I think he's going to be a damn good goalie again in
Boston and pairing him with a guy like Swayman,
I have no issue with it at all.
I just feel like why not just
keep Olmark? You know they work well together.
You know it works. You're just
brought in another goalie, similar salaries.
It makes a million dollars less.
Just hold on to Olmark until next year
and around midseason, some teams panicking.
You're going to get more than a first rounder
for him or even wait to the deadline like you were going to this year
and you're going to get more than a 25th overall pick.
I have heard they aren't shopping the first round pick, though.
We heard that down on the ice last night.
They're aggressively shopping it.
They need help.
They need help in the center position.
And I don't know how you go about doing that.
Dry saddle.
I don't think that's happening.
Yeah, September a long way off as well. I think that'll be
a distraction to have an Omakale. That could
be a distraction in the locker room, right, if you know you're going to
trade him. So, anyways, moving right along.
San Jose picked up defenseman Jake Wallman
in a second round pick in a trade with Detroit.
The old future considerations. He's
got two more years at 3.4 mil.
This feels almost like a salary dump.
Eisenman was done with the gritty.
I heard that. That's what I heard.
He saw those gritties.
He's like, you're going to the worst team in the league.
So it's kind of an odd deal.
I think Wallman played pretty well in Detroit.
Didn't know much about him.
All of a sudden, he scored some big goals, playing a lot of minutes.
But maybe that's a move with something else in mind.
I don't know.
But I think Mike Greer's looking at it like,
we need veterans who are proven NHLers in here.
And they've done a good job, and they got Goudreau over from New York in that weird waivers move.
And who else did they bring over?
San Jose grabbed somebody else in the past little while.
Bodley Goudreau.
No, I just said him.
I'm sorry.
I was reading the next thing.
I don't know.
I can't.
Oh, no.
Will Smith signed.
Yeah, Will Smith signed.
Maybe that's what I was thinking of, and they're going to have Celebrini.
But I think good move for San Jose.
Maybe Detroit has something else in mind.
I think Detroit next year will see Edvinson coming up from the minors,
playing a much bigger role.
I know he was up for a little bit this year, but no more gritty.
Yeah, sometimes it's about moving a guy to give another guy room to come in.
That's a great point, Woody.
The Avalanche, they signed forward Casey Middlestat to a 317.25 million extension.
Comes out to 5.75 average annual value.
Merles, what did you take on this signing?
They still changed the scenery.
Yeah, I mean, they traded a guy, Bo Byram, who is going to be a top two defenseman forever.
And you had to make sure you don't lose him.
So no matter what he did he
could have had zero goals in the playoffs and i still think you got to resign him just because
of what you gave up for him so but he did well he was second line i don't know if he's the second
line center on a cup winning team but i mean he he's he's nhl he's an nhl he's this nhl or second
liner but i don't think he's a cup winning i liner. I think that if he wants to get there, he has to have a major, major offseason
and gain that half a step of speed.
I don't think he's fast enough in order to keep up at the pace
in which Colorado wants to play.
I thought he had a solid playoff.
But when Jamie Benz burning you off of a fucking 200-foot sprint down the ice,
I don't know if your speed is where it needs to be, but I was happy with the impact he
made in Colorado.
And this is a nice little bridge deal to see if he's able to get to that place.
And look at like, maybe not next year, but in years two or three, if you say the cap
keeps bumping up four and then maybe even another four, like he could end up being your
third line center.
And that's an incredible third line center who can chew guys up in that spot,
but still looking to replace that cadre.
They've just been trying to replace that.
Now, Colorado has so many question marks.
Biggest for me is Nachushkin.
What is going to happen there?
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows how that will play out.
And then Landeskog.
Will Landeskog be able to go?
It sounds like he's definitely going to be giving it a shot,
but who knows if he'll be able to be the player he once was.
So there are a lot of kind of question marks around Colorado.
But when you have McKinnon and you have Rontanen and you have Makar,
it's like that core, you're set up to be a successful team.
It's just the pieces around it.
You see Florida, you need those pieces.
You need those depth pieces and those players that can produce
when the game gets even rougher.
So Middlestad, I don't know if he has that grit that they're chasing
that they lost with Kadri, but maybe he can grow into it.
He's still pretty young.
Yeah, I just think when you're going to beat Colorado,
if you are going to go to the Cup, you're going to have to beat Vegas.
You're going to have to beat Edmonton.
You're going to have to beat Dallas,
and that's not the second-line center that can beat those teams.
Yeah, he had 10 points in 18 regular season games,
but he actually had 9 points in 11 playoff games.
I thought he had a pretty good playoffs himself.
Winnipeg Jets signed defenseman Dylan DeMello to a four-year,
19.6 million extension.
Comes out to a shade under 5 million a year.
31-year-old.
He was San Jose's sixth-round pick way back in 2011.
Biz, what do you got for us on this one?
Repeat it, sorry.
Sorry, no problem.
Dylan DeMello, four years,  19.6 mil extension with the Jets.
31-year-old defenseman.
Yeah, I actually think that their back end overperformed expectations this season.
And I like his game.
I think he's a solid.
He's probably, what, a number three, probably more of a four on a Stanley Cup winning team.
I think he blocks a ton of shots.
I feel like I had him in fantasy,
and he was always winning me the block shot category.
He's a gamer, and he's a foxhole guy,
and a good second-layer guy where if you want to establish that culture,
you need to keep around.
So I think it's a solid deal.
And I don't know,
Paul Maurice seems to think they have the recipe to win one.
I don't know about that.
I think he just really appreciates the fan base
and his time there,
and how it all ended with him resigning. And I think he just wants success for that team base and his time there and how it all ended with
him resigning and i think he just wants success for that yeah i don't know if he actually believed
yeah a little tummy sticks like okay i left you guys i end up winning a stanley cup but i really
hope you get yours yeah i don't know if you gave him truth it's like if you leave your wife and
you find someone better and yours i just want my ex to find happiness yeah i don't know i'm probably
not going there on that one i'd like to not think about that but maybe i don't know. I'm probably not going there on that one. I'd like to not think about that, but maybe. I don't know.
Do you hope your ex finds somebody
better than you? Yes. Okay, that's a nice
guy move for you. That's true love.
Our buddy Schmaltzy, but the big scoop.
The big tuna. Them O'Brien signed a
3 million extension with Utah, man.
Well, he knew what he was doing when they did that introduction
at the press conference. He's like, I'm going to make
these fans love me. They're going to have
to resign. I think every team should have a guy like that.
He's a morale guy.
He's just great in the community, shows up every day to work.
He's willing to fight anybody.
He creates energy.
He was a fan favorite with the Arizona Coyotes.
I think that's going to transfer over to Utah.
And especially early on, establishing a culture and a fan base,
you need guys who are willing to not only do everything they need
at the rink and on the ice,
but also get in the community and shake hands
and make fans feel like they're a part of it.
And I think Spicy Tuna is the perfect guy for that.
You saw it with that intro when they first got there.
And I think that it might have been Schmaltzy
who gave him the nickname.
Or maybe it was Heat Daddy.
So they're huge. I think they were the ones who actually broke the trade. I think it been Schmaltzy who gave him the nickname. Or maybe it was Heat Daddy. So they're huge on it.
I think they were the ones who actually broke the trade.
I think it was Schmaltzy.
And couldn't be happier for Liam O'Brien.
Kind of like he's a better player than I was,
but kind of like a similar type guy where he's just like a fan favorite.
Vibes guy.
He's a vibes guy.
He's a glue guy.
He's a menace.
He's a menace.
He's not crushing everything in Old Town like I was.
I think he's happily married with a kid,
but that's probably the only difference,
and that he's making over a million, which I never did.
For Jeff Skinner, expected to be bought out by the Sabres perhaps today.
He's got three years left on that eight-year, 72 million deal he signed.
He's a 10-time 20-goal scorer, 6-time 30-goal scorer,
and a one-time 40-goal scorer. Whoever picks up 30-goal scorer, 1-time 40-goal scorer.
Whoever picks up this 32-year-old this
offseason is going to be pretty happy. He's a good little player, man.
No, you immediately just go and
bet that they will not make the playoffs.
Whatever team he signs on, there's the lock of next
season for your bettors out there.
I wasn't going to call them.
It's very tough if you're a playoff team
with cup aspirations
to go sign a guy that's never played in the playoffs.
I hope he gets a shot with a really good team.
The good thing is with his bio and how much money he's made and will still receive,
he'll be willing to take close to league minimum, I would think.
I mean, he'll probably have to because even though he has numbers,
league minimum is probably a little bit of an exaggeration,
but it will not be a number where you're like, oh my God, maybe 2 million a year.
Duchesne and Dallas kind of thing like him.
Exactly.
And I hope he gets in the playoffs.
I hope he really gets a chance to play in the best time of year.
But we talked about that, I think, a few episodes ago for a while.
Big congratulations to Glenn Sather, a hockey life NHL legend.
He was serving as senior advisor to the owner of the Rangers.
He announced his retirement from the game on Wednesday.
The 88-year-old Sather was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame back in 97.
He won five Stanley Cups with the Oilers, the first four as coach and GM.
The final one as GM.
This guy played in the NHL.
Just, like I said, a Hockey Life, a Hockey legend.
So congrats to Slots on an unreal career.
A great guy, too.
So enjoy retirement, my friend.
Couple clicks, boys.
Couple. Absolutely. Always take a my friend. Couple clicks, boys. Couple clicks.
Absolutely.
Always taking him with the stogie.
Absolutely.
I would love to have an hour sit-down with Wayne to talk about Glenn Sather stories.
I'd love to sit down with Glenn.
Yeah.
Oh, fuck, if he would do it.
Maybe.
He would maybe do it.
You never know.
He probably doesn't even know what a podcast is.
You never know.
Congrats to the Hershey Bears as well.
The 13th call to cup in team history.
They went back-to-back for the third time in team history. They went back to back for the third time in team history.
They beat Coachella Valley for the second straight.
This time is just dominant on the HL.
Poor Dan Biles and all the guys at Coachella to lose again,
to play this long.
It is hilarious to me that they played a call the cup final game on the
night of game seven.
I think that's maybe the most insane thing I've ever heard.
Just move it a day. It's the minors, but Dan Biles was moving on the night of game seven. I think that's maybe the most insane thing I've ever heard. Just move it a day.
It's the minors.
But Dan Bosman's moving on, and he's moving up.
So it's hard, and it's heartbreaking, that is.
And I'm sure he feels horrible for the team and himself.
He's back in the NHL, so happy for him.
And I think it's a great thing when you have a coach that's down in the minors
and he's seeing the prospects and he's working with guys
that are going to have to be a big part of the NHL team
in the future and then being able to bring that coach up,
I think that is the dream scenario for most teams.
If you can have your AHL coach work his way up and be there for a while
and then come up to the NHL and know a bunch of the younger prospects,
I think that's perfect.
So I love what's happened in Seattle.
Yeah, and I think he was our assistant in Wilkes-Barre
when we went to the finals against the Chicago Wolves,
and we lost that one in six.
So he's now at least been to three Calder Cup finals and never won.
But going back to Bosman, he does have that Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh
when he took over for Tarion.
And then afterward, he ended up going to, what was it?
Buffalo.
He was in Buffalo, and then that was it for his NHL.
As a head coach, I believe so.
Yeah.
And he was a young head coach, right?
So a lot of learning lessons early on.
That fizzled out.
He went and reestablished his coaching abilities in the minors.
He's had success there.
So, I mean, look at Paul Maurice and how long it took him to win a Stanley Cup
and become a full-time NHL coach
so I wish him nothing but the best he was a great guy he was fun to be around so I think it's a good
move for for Seattle like you said to to already have a connection to the next wave of player
that's going to come up and have to fill in those roles I think that's very very vital what up guys
Witt here and I am here to talk to you about Lucy. Lucy is the obvious choice for the true nicotine pouch connoisseurs
and that's why they're the official nicotine pouch partner of Barstool Sports.
Lucy pouches go up to 12 milligram strength and have a unique shape that feels great.
Lucy breakers are the best in the business.
All I have now and they're the only pouches with a hydration capsule inside.
They're a totally new kind of pouch,
only available from Lucy,
and the flavor lasts forever.
Each Breaker's pouch contains a hydration capsule
that you crack open with your teeth
before tossing it in your lip.
The capsule releases a burst of flavor
and helps release nicotine faster
for an experience that you can't find in any other pouch.
Gas-tasting pouches get the job done,
but once you've tried Lucy,
you won't want anything else in your pocket.
I've given them to a bunch of my buddies at home that have had competitors, and they're blown away.
I'm ordering them for all those guys now, and it's because Lucy is the best.
So get Lucy shipped straight to your door.

To go over to the Hershey side, Brian Helmer, his old teammate of mine,
he's VP of Hockey Operations, I believe.
He was the guy when we were in San Antonio together,
he was going to play his 1,000th pro game,
and he was the guy that always had the big goatee.
So Jans made all of us on the team grow out our beards, and then right before the game, we all the big goatee. So Jantz made all of us on the team grow out our beards.
And then right before the game, we all shaved the goatee for him.
So we all played a sound game with a goatee.
That's awesome.
That was pretty fun.
That is awesome.
That's such a Jantz.
Great guy.
With the Bic razors, too, so everyone's bleeding out.
Oh, yeah.
Warm up.
Oh, gee.
You get the fucking God.
Is Todd Nelson their head coach down there in Hershey?
Todd Nelson?
Is that it?
I don't know.
He was in Edmonton, I think. They I don't know, but that Hershey's there.
He was in Edmonton, I think, at one point.
That organization is crazy.
They just win.
That's all they do.
This November, good stuff coming.
We have the CHL USA Prospects Challenge.
We're going to have the American kids facing off
versus the Canadian kids this November.
It's a two-game series.
Did that kind of jump out at you?
Basically, they split it.
This is incredible.
This is awesome.
And you've had the National Development Program
or National Team Development Program, excuse me,
become so successful and become so different.
Same as I said I didn't play in this NHL.
The NTDP that I was at is nothing like now.
These kids are so good, so skilled,
and then you've always had the CHL Top Prospects game.
So the under-18 team in Plymouth, Michigan,
those are the draft-eligible kids, most of them,
unless they're late birthdays that year.
And they've played around.
They play college teams.
They play USHL.
They play international.
But they never face off against the best draft-eligible players in the CHL.
And now, R.A., I wish it was two out of three.
I think that maybe would have been a little bit better
to guarantee yourself a victor as opposed to if they split this,
there isn't a winner.
Well, aggregate.
Yeah, I know, but if you win 4-1 and then lose 2-0,
are you really the champion?
It's a little odd to me.
Yeah.
But it's not even more important.
According to the rules.
It's not even more important.
Well, the rules you just made up for aggregate.
What do you mean?
It happens in soccer.
You're the soccer guy, Mr. Chelsea guy.
Yeah, yeah.
Is this the Champions League?
Are we talking Champions League or draft prospects in the CHL and the USA?
Well, we're talking about something that was brand new.
We're talking about something that was newly established.
And my point was two out of three would be better.
And then you're like, well, aggregate.
When has aggregate been used in hockey?
I think it has in the past.
When?
At some point.
I think we had that in ECAC's first round
when I played. Oh, sick. What a leap. A long time ago.
The EZAC. It's like a high-end show.
You do not like his answer? No, I just think that
if you're going to lean towards the EZAC
first round in 1997,
you're reaching a little bit. All I'm saying
is I wanted two out of three, but
no matter what, it's awesome because
for the players, you're getting to face
off with the Canadians and the Americans that you're going up against in the draft, and for the the players, you're getting to face off with the Canadians and the Americans
that you're going up against in the draft,
and for the scouts, you're seeing them all together.
So you don't have to watch kids just in the CHL,
and then you get to see one-on-one,
like maybe Haggins and then the top prospect next year in the CHL,
like see this battle between them two.
I think it's cool.
I might have missed it.
Is it USA versus Canada with those kids, or is it CHL versus USA?
It's the best top.
I read it's the top draft eligible players in the CHL versus the under-18 team.
So there can be an American kid that's on that CHL team playing against Team USA,
which would be interesting.
Wow, didn't think of that.
Oh, so maybe you're saying it'll only be Canadian kids.
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, it's like a big high know. Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, it's like a big high-end showcase, I guess,
is probably a good way to put it, no?
I think we should have probably read the fine print, but who gives a fuck?
No, I was just thinking more of an opinion.
You're correct.
A kid will play against the U.S., a U.S. kid.
That's weird.
Tim O'Bay, head coach, John Cooper,
he's going to coach Canada at the Four Nations Face-off in the 2026 Olympics. No surprise there,
I'd say. Not at all. And he's got one thing left.
You get the Cups, get that gold medal,
and he'll be in the Hall of Fame anyway. Yeah, no doubt. The longest tenured
active coach. Just finished his 12th season
out in Tampa. He was going to coach Canada
back at the 22 Olympics, but the NHL
did not partake. Biz, what do you got?
Oh, it's a no-brainer.
And I think he just signed like a
a one-year extension so he's got two years left now at the tampa bay lightning too
so i mean we talk about these coaches and the paydays that they're getting uh once this this
dynasty run for the tampa bay lightning is over i mean who the fuck he's gonna get the bag oh my
god he's gonna get it he's gonna get a. Yep. Right? Like six, seven million a year.
So he knows how to manage all those egos and those unbelievable players
and the press conferences, everything.
So, like I said, I don't think there was really another option.
All right.
Congratulations, pal.
Happy for you.
The Kings debuted their new threads, man.
They're pretty sweet, the LA Kings.
I love the throwback ones.
Yeah.
And I love how on the bottom they made the bar across very thick.
So it just adds different dimensions and layers to the jersey.
I like the rebrand.
And, of course, they're going to be playing with those matte black buckets,
which are way better, in my opinion, than the silver ones.
And they're just a lot classier.
So kudos to them.
Way better than what the Ducks going on the ducks orange i was
like i know i i didn't hate the jersey it's just the pants being orange i was like ah but as we've
seen with dallas and their like neon yellow or green jersey like it's about the younger kids
it's about selling the jerseys and wanting these 14, 15 year olds to want this cool orange Jersey.
And maybe it pops off on camera for the,
on TV,
but I didn't love just that much orange in a uniform.
I wasn't a huge fan.
Yeah.
Just to listen to the ducks about an hour and a half after the Kings put
their tweet out,
the ducks did as well.
But I think Radko Gudis is maybe the first Radko Gudis,
the first guy in history to make a duck actually look mean.
I mean,
that's what ducks just kind of a weak name for a hockey team.
It's, you know, kind of a pussy bird, right?
Who's afraid of a duck?
I think never saw a blue duck.
Ducks are very resilient.
Ducks work their dick off, don't they?
Yeah.
Alex Maruello, he's walking away from ownership of the Arizona Coyotes.
Oh, time.
Holy shit, buddy.
That was quick.
Yeah.
A friend of the show, Craig Morgan, reported the news come four days after the Arizona Coyotes. About time. Holy shit, buddy. That was quick. Yeah, a friend of the show, Craig Morgan, reported
the news come four days
after the Arizona State Land Department
canceled that auction
that Marolo was trying to get
this fucking tract of land
to build an arena on.
The land was,
what's the term you use?
It was zoned
for like a 3,500 seat arena.
So it wasn't even zoned properly
to build what they wanted to build.
So that's why I think
even at a certain point, like one of the people
in the community came out and said like, this isn't
going to be built on it even if they win the land.
So I just think they were
way in over their head. A great
business move by the Morelos though
because I think they make out making about 400
million on the whole overall deal.
Take your money, get the fuck out of hockey.
You're not the type of owners that the NHL is looking for.
You don't know how to treat your employees.
You're cutthroat in the businesses that you've ran before.
If you want to go run them like that, go do it.
That's not how the NHL operates.
You have to treat people like people.
You know what?
The Panthers are perfect proof of what an owner means exactly and you saw
florida flounder for years and then vinnie viola comes in and with his west point background and
matt caldwell and all these guys and they've changed everything you need you need a superstar
owner to become stanley cup champions i'm telling you it matters so much
because as you said it's the treatment of everyone whether it's a secretary whether it's a janitor it
doesn't matter when you have an owner that just takes pride in how he's running that entire
business and team it changes the landscape of everything and he was that guy was that guy was
a pigeon even for kate's right like the money they'll spend, like he'll go down there and say,
what do you guys need from me in order to be successful?
Like down to them hiring the mental coach.
So the budgets they have and to say,
hey, listen, here's the amount of money
to go get these types of resources
in order to have success
because he brought a bunch of his West Point buddies
over too, right, Biola?
Where they help run the organization.
So these guys are the type of guys
who are up at the crack of dawn,
you know, going for cold dips in the fucking ocean.
Our guy Bryce Holwig, he's a West Point guy.
I don't even know his exact title.
I feel like he does everything down there.
He's COO.
COO, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, the NHL finally cut and beat here.
Hopefully the biz, they can learn some lessons
so something like this does never happen again.
I mean, the guy's reputation wasn't great beforehand.
The owners were sick and tired of leaking oil
and covering the cost
of it because the league owned the team
and ultimately this guy
came on board and it seemed like he
had enough money and he wanted to make a difference
and pulled the wool over their eyes
and hey, it's a learning experience
and move on where nowadays
they just got Ryan Smith
from Utah, another incredible person
and a visionary.
And I think the NHL has finally got rid of, get rid of some problems and brought on some better people.
Actually, I met a woman from Utah at the airport the other night.
She was very excited to have a team.
I told her you're going to have a real good team very soon out there with all the prospects in the pipeline.
Chicklets Cup registration is open.
The ball street hockey is full with teams waitlisted.
We do have co-ed in women's division spots available.
As for the roller division, the D division is full,
but other divisions do have a couple slots.
Of course, we'll be in London, Ontario, September 19th and 20th.
Oh, yeah, memes is hometown, folks.
You can register at bossdualsports.com slash events.
Merle's?
What went on with the Big Deal Selects meeting on the bus?
I didn't really get to catch all of it with Terry.
Terry was fucking drunker than a maggot.
I just said, Terry, I think you might have to retire.
You and Biz are brutal.
And Terry, he just fired his world championship ring right in my face.
And he's a ball hockey Hall of Famer.
Yeah, I was just trying to get him going a little bit.
I just said, listen, you guys are just nonstop talking about the talent
and the heart and how much you guys mean to each other,
which is all true, but you haven't won.
And if you don't win, like how often can you keep trotting back
the same people?
But his buddy was there.
I forget his name.
Apparently he's a game breaker.
We hear this every year.
A future ball hockey fan.
Every year he's, oh, this is the best ball hockey player.
Well, why didn't you have him the last four tournaments?
I've told Biz he needs to coach.
He needs to retire.
I think G got some information from some of the organizers
as to some of the A Division ball hockey teams
that have signed up since.
Yeah, they said they're 10x the Godfathers.
So the Godfathers dominated last year.
Dominated.
And they said there's multiple teams that are 10x the Godfathers,
so Biz needs to load up.
So currently there's a tire
there's currently there's eight teams in the top division correct for ball hockey i was even
talking about maybe even opening up another four slots so it's 12 teams to make it even more
competitive because all of a sudden all these like people from quebec want to come over who
are apparently savages and i would like to make it like a money division
where every team yeah every team who signs up every guy throws in an extra hundred bucks and
then you know if you have 12 teams 100 bucks a guy let's say there's 10 bucks a guy i don't know
math very well but that's a decent chunk of change for the winners to bring home we should figure out
some sort of cash prize anyways i think for roller aer A, for Street A, both teams deserve something. Definitely for ball hockey because
we have actual professionals showing
up on every team. We got professionals
in A Roller. I know, but we're talking about
professional ball hockey teams. Guys
who go play in the World Championships.
How many teams in the
ball hockey division have... Multiple.
Multiple. Eight guys who have...
100. 100 guys that come from
nationals. I want to see names and I want to see highlights.
100.
You need Ennis.
You guys mentioned Terry Ryan.
I actually did help him get into the game the other night.
I was like, T, you all right there?
He had his phone, but he hadn't had his ticket downloaded.
You don't have to sign up whatever app, Ticketmaster app, whatever.
So he hands me his phone.
It's an Android.
I've had it.
I was like, I literally was like this.
I was like, does anybody work at Android? Like 10 times, finally some guy come over, like help me walk through an Android. I've had it. I was like, I literally was like this. I was like, does anybody work at Android?
Like 10 times.
Finally, some guy come over, like help me walk through the Android.
I've seen these two trying to get into the game.
I do remember on the bus where you had it.
You're like, Terry, this isn't good, but I'm the one that has to lecture you.
You're like, settle down, Terry.
I was like, this isn't this is bad.
You know, you're in real bad shape.
A little bit of responsibility for our is good.
Sometimes.
Yeah, not a bad thing.
Come see us in a couple hours. We're going to be at
Stadium Swim at Circa at
5.30. It's an awesome time. I can't wait to get
over there. Right now, we're interviewing, I think
in about an hour, Macklin Celebrini.
I can't wait to talk to him. We'll be
dropping that this summer at some point.
We got two episodes left, guys,
and we're leaving you with a banger
on the last episode of the season.
I cannot wait until you guys get to hear that.
Should we tease it?
Do it.
Guys, we got Mark Messier for over an hour live in Edmonton.
And we'll be dropping him on our last full podcast together.
July 9th.
It'll be on July 9th.

R.A. is going to come in for the intros.
We have some other amazing interviews lined up for you guys.
We're not going to divulge who we have, but you guys will be teed up
for some summer comment, especially if you guys are commuters
or you're on the boat or wherever.
We have some legends of the game who are going to come on
and tell some awesome stories, and you guys will be taken care of.
But it's been an unbelievable rip for us, an unreal end to the season.
We're so
grateful for all of you who come by and listen on a weekly basis even despite how polarizing our
brand can be at times but as whit mentioned at the top of the show we're a circus we're not your
basic media source we're just a bunch of goofs who get together and and want to talk about hockey
and do what we love and make silly content so on on that note, we've got a sandbagger tomorrow with a few goofballs.
We've got another appearance on Thursday.
Tomorrow at Lee's Discount Liquor starting at 145.
That's 4230 South Rainbow Boulevard in Las Vegas, Nevada.
So we've got two appearances in Vegas.
Come stop by if you're here.
We've got the NHL Draft.
We'll be there for a little bit.
We'll be at the awards as
well. And once again,
congratulations to the Florida Panthers
on an incredible run. The entire
organization, back-to-back finals
and you guys finally pull off and get your
first one. Well deserved and
it's so good for the growth of the game
especially in South Florida. Look at the
domination of Tampa and Florida
over the past few years,
and it continues to grow the game.
So you guys well-deserved,
and looking forward to hearing from Walt and Matthew.
Yeah, let's see what happens.
We love it.
All right, everybody.
Great show.
See you.
Peace.
You can get like a G,
but how much is your love?
They say you're drunk in speech,
it's just so good
I like to poke the bear, I like to stir the pot
But then you come on in and take it up a notch
You hit me with a cheap shot
A cheap shot
She hit me with a cheap shot
A cheap shot
I said she needs a detox
To cleanse her mind
Another week rolls in
We're on the road again
Thought I was safe and sound in my minivan
But I said something that crossed the line
And I know she felt it
Someone said she could have a free one on the chin She went below the bell, shit Outro Music
