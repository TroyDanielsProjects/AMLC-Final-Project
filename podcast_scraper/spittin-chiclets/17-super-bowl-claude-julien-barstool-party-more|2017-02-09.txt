Give it a try. I've never seen anything anything like this this was the most amazing game i've
ever witnessed and maybe i'm being a little prisoner of the moment but i don't think so
it's starting to sink in that was the most improbable comeback in all of sports history
where there was no way because the new england patriots Tom Brady and Bill Belichick were all-time bad.
Line passes, pick, intercepted Robert Alford. He's gone. There are no flags,
and the Falcons add to their lead. Alford left throws, passes, caught. That's the new.
Never had a 100-yard game in the NFL. Here is Coleman.
End zone.
Touchdown.
Followed by all-time great.
Out of the shotgun, Ryan.
It's hit.
Ball is out.
This is a fumble.
New England has it. It looked like it.

Hello everybody and welcome to episode 17 of Spit and Chicklets
Brought to you by Barstool Sports
Say hello gentlemen
What up, what up
How are we boys
I'm actually producing
I'm Mikey Grinnells and our boy Ryan Whitney
There's definitely some extra jubilation in Boston this week, boy.
A little different podcast today for us, just for the beginning.
Yeah, we'll be able to talk shit to all you non-Patriot fans
and enjoy all of the wins and what comes with being a Patriots fan with all of our current Boston.
Yeah, we're going to be mass holes for the first couple of minutes here.
We're just going to be straight up and tell you.
Well, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't talk about the Super Bowl, whether we
were Pats fans or not, because
I mean, first overtime Super
Bowl ever. Can I
ask you quick about the overtime? Please do.
So you've told me
last year when we started doing this podcast,
before it was on Barstool, you told me
around the Super Bowl, yeah, I always bet the
overtime. I always bet the overtime. It's 9-1
or something? Yeah, it was 8-1, 7-1.
And you did it.
And I remember you go, it's going to happen at some point.
And I actually thought it was a good idea, and I just forgot.
But you did it again and finally hit it.
Finally hit it.
I mean, I probably just paid for the last 15 years of betting it.
So I got my money back, essentially.
But it was huge.
It swung my day. I mean, I got
a couple hundred in it, 8-1, then the rest
did a little under 7-1.
And it was a difference in my day.
With how close the games are, it's kind of crazy.
That's high odds. I think it's crazy
that it's never gone to overtime before.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's why it was betting every day.
I mean, it could have went another 50 years without
one, but I just kept saying,
there's been so many, especially with the Pats, so many of their Super Bowls have been close to overtime.
And the two evenly matched teams, I thought, okay, that might happen.
I threw a little bit more maybe than last year.
So the fact I went to OT was a huge difference.
I went from paying five guys to collecting off three guys basically because of OT.
Oh, that is so nice.
Did you what you have?
Who'd you bet?
I bet the Patriots every day, four days in a row, starting last Sunday.
You bet the money line, right?
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
The money line is getting better.
And then finally it stopped improving.
And I was like, all right, well, I'm done.
Plenty's in there.
Great action.
And then just because I'm an idiot, we're sitting around Sunday.
My buddies are over.
You're so antsy before the game. It's 3 o'clock like we got three and a half hours just start going through
prop bets i made like 14 or no you know 12 prop prop bets sorry oh for 12 so i lost money oh man
with them winning and i had and if i just listened to my original betting during the beginning that's
why i'm such a mush.
Yeah, you got to go.
When you gamble, you got to go what you got.
And it is easy to get caught up.
I bet a lot of that shit, too.
And I was like, the Gatorade color, the over-under on the anthem,
missed that one, missed the coin toss.
I would have got the coin toss if you could do it in overtime.
I said heads for show.
The coin toss, I think there's a special degeneracy
needed to bet the coin toss.
The fact
that that game, how it was played,
Grinnelli...
Grinnelli was there.
I'm still lost at words.
Quickly, before we go into you being there,
I can
fully admit, I was like, they can't
win.
I was like, this is...
No, I never said that.
I never said that.
But when it was 28-3 with five minutes to go in the third quarter,
what are you supposed to think?
It was just kind of silent in my apartment.
But one thing you don't do is get up and leave.
And that brings me to my point.
Oh, the Mocky Mock?
No, get up and leave.
Come on, feel it, feel it.
Oh, my kid's sick.
Yeah, kid looked real sick right now. That brings me to my point because there was the Maki-Maki? No, get up. Come on, feel it, feel it. Oh, my kid's sick. Yeah, kid looked real sick
right when I was at
That brings me to my point
because there was a stoolie
sitting behind us
and, you know,
decked out in fire Goodell gear,
head to toe.
Did you ask him
if he listened to
Spittin' Chicklets?
I did not ask him
if he listened to
Spittin' Chicklets,
but I hope he does
because he left at halftime
yelling,
fuck Belichick,
he's a fucking idiot.
What?
Section 612,
row M,
seat 18 and 19.
Wow. If anyone knows who this kid is... In barstool gear
and let you... So you don't know if he left the game?
Decked out head to toe in barstool
gear. He didn't come back to his seat
for the third quarter. Did not come back for the rest of the game. So he could have stayed
in the stadium. We don't... You know, maybe
he's like, alright, I gotta change the lock. I mean, he's... But if he's screaming stayed in the stadium. We don't, you know, maybe he's like, all right, I got to change the lock.
I mean, he's.
But if he's screaming at Belichick.
He's screaming, fuck, like, I'm out of here.
Fuck this.
Like, fuck Belichick.
He was shit-faced.
But.
What gets.
Go ahead.
I'm sorry.
Go right.
No, no, no.
I'm just saying that at halftime, the only thing I said, and even in the third quarter
when it really kind of looked over, I was like, if there's one guy, it's Brady.
Yeah.
That's all I can say.
Like, there's one guy, it's Brady. That's all I can say. There's one guy, it's Brady.
You just have to believe it.
Now I can't wait to see the sound effects tonight.
What gets me is on Twitter, and it could be the Super Bowl or Week 2 or anything.
I wasn't even on it really.
How many fucking people?
I just want to be like, do you watch fucking football at all?
Do you watch the NFL at all?
Now granted, the pass will get smoked, but there's don't. But there's two halves in every game.
I mean, you see it every week.
Like, people who watch the NFL every week on Twitter.
Like, pronounce games all over.
One by bat.
Yeah, I know.
It's like, it's all over.
It's like, asshole, there's a whole other half left.
But at halftime, I wasn't that.
That's not when I was completely panicked.
I was talking mid-third, quarter, and they gave up another score.
After that fucking onside kick, I was like, what are they doing?
Dostoevsky missed the extra point, too.
Yeah, that didn't rattle me as much because they needed so many points,
but still, we saw it in Denver where you need the two points.
Yeah.
I mean, it didn't matter.
I never gave up hope, I'll be honest with you, because it's Brady, man.
I just kept doing the math in my head, and I think maybe it was because
I was so financially invested that if they lost, I was fucked.
And I was banged up, too.
Like, seven ways till Sunday.
So I just kind of, like, was like, all right.
I just kept doing the math in my head.
I'm like, all right, they're in.
They keep getting breaks.
They keep getting breaks.
And, I mean, it just, like, played out.
I couldn't believe it.
I had, I opened my door at one point, and I was, like, screaming like a maniac.
It's not fucking over yet.
People probably thought I was a lunatic.
They probably thought I was, like, 1970s.
No, they're like, his wife's leaving him and he just doesn't want to admit it.
I was going fucking ape shit.
It was just crazy.
It was just an insane game.
And, you know, like to have Brady do it.
And plus, like, the other thing, too, is the whole, all these pussies online, like,
like, like people who didn't like fucking who didn't like Trump making it like they
were using the Patriots as a proxy for their hate for Trump,
which is like, go fuck yourself.
I'm not a fan of the guy either, but don't lump me in.
It's ironic because they're like, oh, don't judge people
and don't generalize.
And here you are generalizing all Patriots fans saying,
we're all bigots or whatever the fuck you assign us to.
And it's like, no, go fuck yourself.
It's a football game.
We're rooting for a team.
It has nothing to do with politics.
Just like when you watch a movie and you don't say, well, fucking Mel Gibson's a conservative.
I don't want to watch the movie.
Jon Voight's a fucking conservative.
I'm not watching Ray Dunham this year.
It was so fucking stupid.
Like people making donations to the ACLU every time Brady gets sacked.
It was so fucking crazy.
Like it was like it's entertainment.
It's a separate thing.
Like I've never like tied my, like, my entertainment or sports.
Same thing.
I don't even want to give these people.
And people are so fucking obnoxious about it.
So when they won for that, it was great to, like, rub it in people's faces who were making, like, the Patriots, like, were anti-fucking social justice or whatever bullshit they were clamoring to.
So to have that.
I didn't even.
I don't even care.
Like, if you hate.
I like that people hate the Patriots.
I think it's so awesome.
No, and that's fine on a sporting level.
But when they were adding it like this social thing, like be part of the resistance, root for Atlanta,
I was like, go fuck yourself.
You know what I mean?
Don't include me in your political things.
And again, it was mostly left-leaning people who were the free, open-minded ones.
And here they are fucking slandering a bunch of people as big bigots and fucking racist because of a football team they and it was for a football team they
root for with such fucking hypocrisy yeah i understand i like that get that out get that out
you're just you're you're just released a lot i think you needed that and how about fucking that
fucking fraud good doll too like pretending like i mean how fucking much okay so so he's
barstool sports he's in the press conference all right tell me
why is if he gets asked that question okay and if imagine if he just said yeah you know what um i
did ban him because the the president of the company or whatever the owner has threatened my
life for the last eight months yeah people would have. Like, why can't you be like a normal human being?
Like, if you just said something, like, you got to be such a pigeon fucking robot that
you're like that awkward.
You can't even have like a normal, like, answer to anything.
Can't even.
Well, somebody else took that.
He reminds me of that.
No, we'll get to it in a couple of minutes.
Don Sweeney.
Just like how you give no answer answers.
Like, you just talk for three minutes, and you don't fucking say anything.
How about Matt Patricia wearing the barstool Roger Goodell's a clown shirt getting off the plane, though?
Hilarious.
I know.
Like, doesn't this guy want to be a head coach in the NFL?
I don't think he gives a shit.
He's probably been drinking all night.
All the players were saying it yesterday.
Like, I'm surprised that I'll open all the players.
Amendola is wearing the Faya Goodell hat.
Gronk's Jen Goodell sucks.
And another, like, great thing.
Providence, yeah.
I don't know.
It was just such a great, it was such a great moment.
And, like, in terms of, like, I mean, how much can you talk about him?
But Brady's, like, kind of in conversation for the greatest athlete of all time.
Yeah, like Jordan.
And he's probably going to
win another one.
I don't know if it was Grinnells who texted
me the other day, but it was like
Brady now has the same amount of
championships as
Burr and Bird combined.
And he's got one more than Gretzky.
Gretzky won four Cups.
I mean, of course,
Messi won six.
No, I know.
You know, he's in that conversation
as one of the, you know,
like you say, MJ basketball,
Tom Brady football.
From an athlete standpoint,
you know, have you ever been down
in a big game like that
and had to come back and win?
Because, like, I'm talking down big,
like 7-1 in a Stanley Cup game.
Somebody said,
oh, did you ever have a big comeback in any hockey games?
And I remember one time in Pittsburgh, we were down 4-0 in the third period late.
And we came back and tied it.
And Crosby, like speaking of legendary athletes, he had like a hat trick or 2-2.
And  but it was a regular season game, right?
Like I'd never had any experience like that at like the highest level.
Yeah, how far for a championship game
to have the greatest comeback
ever.
Two hours after the game, I was
still giddy. When a game makes you giddy,
as opposed to relieved or
excited or won, but to be
legit giddy.
Watching the coverage.
Like Charlie and
Willy Wonka thing. His grandfather gets out and starts dancing around the house.
That's what I felt like fucking Sunday night.
I couldn't all fucking go to sleep.
So just an amazing game.
Amazing victory.
And then the parade day, we had some more news.
Oh, yeah.
Exactly.
Perfect.
Wow.
What a fucking segue mask.
So it led into the parade when you're all excited.
And I woke up yesterday.
I was doing a radio interview on Sportsnet Radio in Toronto.
And I got the text right as we were going on air.
So it was like perfect timing.
I'm like, no, they didn't cast him on this day.
Yeah.
I was on an airplane.
Dude.
And then they made the press conference for when the parade started.
The same exact time.
That was weak.
The press conference pilot was weak.
And then they delayed the press conference when the parade got delayed.
I'm not kidding.
This all happened.
It was the most embarrassing, fucking pathetic display by an NHL team.
Have you ever seen coaches around the league speak out about another coach being fired like Paul Julian?
No.
There's been 15 coaches coming out with quotes.
Like, basically, can't believe this.
Kind of like, you know, yeah, maybe it's time to move on.
It comes a time when it's time to move on.
He's a great coach.
That never happens.
Like, have some respect.
Even the team's television station didn't broadcast the press conference.
They broadcasted the parade.
Nesson broadcasted the parade, not the press conference.
Oh, really?
If they waited three hours, four hours for the press conference.
Or do it after the Toronto game or do it tomorrow. What, really? If they waited three hours, four hours for the press conference. Or do it after the Toronto game?
Or do it tomorrow?
See, I...
Alright, here's my take.
I think that after Saturday's game,
they made their mind up. Alright, that's it. We're going to fire
Claude, okay? I think they've seen enough.
Now, they're going to...
Okay, when are we going to fire him? If they do it Sunday,
they're going to look like total assholes, okay?
They're going to... The Patriots are in the Super Bowl. Now, if the Bruins fire Claude, that's going to fire them? If they do it Sunday, they're going to look like total assholes, okay? Agreed. The Patriots are in the Super Bowl.
Now, if the Bruins fire Claude, that's going to completely overshadow
or may overshadow.
It's going to take some of the shine.
I agree.
And I think there's a lot of professional courtesy amongst the four sports teams
in Boston.
There's a lot of respect that we're aware of in this town.
So I think they say, okay, we're not going to do it.
And then Monday, the Pats win.
Now, if they do it Monday, now they're stealing the shine.
Now, because the whole region is glowing the next day.
If the Pats fire Claude, they're going to steal some of that thunder, okay?
Fair enough.
Okay, now it's yesterday.
Okay, all right, yeah, it's the parade.
But, okay, you know what?
It's a parade.
Everybody saw the game.
I mean, yeah, a million people go to the parade, but there's a lot more people who watch the game than go to the parade.
I think, okay, we've got to do the parade, but there's a lot more people who watch the game than go to the parade. I think, okay,
we've got to do it today. We've already waited two days. We've deferred to the Patriots twice already,
whether they want to acknowledge that or not.
Okay, yeah, the parade's going on.
Where they fucked up was doing the press comments
during the parade. I have no issue that they
fired him on the day of the parade. I think people are really
making a bigger deal about that than they
should. I mean, it's a fucking parade.
It's not the game itself.
I think, honestly, if the Patriots lost that game, they would have fired them Monday because
there wouldn't have been this glow in the region.
Everyone would have been like...
They would have just added to it.
Yeah, it would have just been, you know, okay.
Why wouldn't you just gas them?
Why wouldn't you literally...
You could gas them after the game Saturday night.
You could have gassed them today.
But if you gas them Saturday night, that's Sunday's, and it's going to take away from the Patriots.
Okay, so why not do it today?
Because they have a game tomorrow.
What's one practice?
Well, that's the thing.
I think when you're bringing in a new coach, and maybe you can tell me,
obviously that's why we have you here,
I think they want to get at least two practices.
Because if they wait until today, now they're going to have one practice today
before their first game with a new coach tomorrow night.
At least by doing it yesterday, you got one more practice.
And I don't know how much of a difference that makes, but I think it was like, okay.
Well, I don't think it makes any difference.
They fired Terrian in Pittsburgh the morning of the game, and Bilesma came in and coached.
And Pittsburgh lost and then went on to win the Stanley Cup.
So that ain't going to happen in Boston.
Right.
And, I mean, if they did wait until today, you know, I mean, what?
They just delayed the inevitable and they burned a day off.
Yeah, okay.
So, I mean, in the end, the day, whatever.
The press conference.
The press conference is bullshit.
And the PR department.
Yeah, that bingo.
Sweeney, like, throws the PR department on the bus.
He sold them.
What did he say?
I actually didn't see that. Good for Steve Buckley, our buddy at the Herald. Greatweeney throws the P.I. department on the bus. He sold them. What did he say? I actually didn't see that.
Good for Steve Buckley, our buddy at the Herald.
Great guy, Steve Buckley.
He held Sweeney's feet to the fire at the press conference.
And he was like, well, why are you doing it now?
Really grilling him on why you're having it then.
And Sweeney says, well, our P.I. department says if you make a decision like this, you should get up there and answer the questions.
It's like, okay, no shit.
First off, you don't have to mention the PI department.
Like 5 o'clock won't work?
Right.
It's like, well, okay, that's fine.
But now you're going to do it at 1130 when you know that no radio TV station in town
can do a live shot because they're all live at the parade.
There'll be less media there.
Now, the Bruins media is going to be there because they're covering them anyways.
He played stupid.
Exactly.
There's a lot of other media that would have went there.
They were minimizing the hit. But it's like, listen, you're the Bruins. He played stupid. Yeah, there's a lot of other media that would have went. They were minimizing the hit.
But it's like, listen, you're the pro ones.
Everybody knows it's 2017.
Media is everywhere.
Just have the press conference later.
Take the fucking hit, and people will move on.
Instead, they do it at 1130, and they make it worse.
They're so poorly run.
How everything goes down there.
Who is that, though?
Who do we blame?
Is that Jacobs, or is that Neely?
I think it stems.
It's Neely and Jacobs.
And then, like, Sweeney's the same way.
I don't understand.
That's the thing.
Like, who's deciding that this is how.
I mean, I don't think it's the PI department.
The media relations always do a good job at Boston.
Take the hit, you know.
You're the GM.
Right.
That's your job.
It was just like, what the fuck are they doing?
And then there was one answer he gave, like, Fluto Shenzel.
Neely's so grumpy, dude.
Flat out asked him.
Big Fluto guy.
Big Fluto guy.
Fluto, Flat Out asked him.
Yeah, Fluto's awesome.
Yeah, he said, like, basically, why'd you fire him?
And he gives, like, there's a two-paragraph answer.
It's online.
And it's just gobbledygook.
It's just like, it looks like a lawyer fighting for, like, a motion in court.
You read it.
Like, I was reading it on air last night.
Take Billy Madison.
And it's like, what the fuck is he saying?
It like talked in circles and he said absolutely nothing.
And it's like people from Boston hate that shit because we're real.
We just give it.
We're real.
We're real.
And we're here.
Yeah.
Just fucking say A, B or C.
Like be a straight shooter.
He talks like a like Harvard fucking lawyer speak, man.
And it's like annoying.
Like you can't get a straight answer. So, like a Harvard fucking lawyer speak, man. And it's like annoying. Like, he can't get a straight answer on them. So, yeah.
Don Sweeney was still playing when I
turned pro, and I remember working out with
Mike Boyle, local. Like, he's trained
everyone. He's the best. He's the best of the
best. So, he was like
in his, like, 14th or 15th season.
He played, I bet you he played 15 years.
He was in Dallas at the time. Yeah, he finished up in Dallas.
And he was the most unfriendly
person I've ever seen.
Usually the older guys like Mike Greer and J.P. Andolfo,
when kids my age turned pro, they were the best guys,
always talking to you, helping you out.
Next door neighbor, J.P. Andolfo.
Yeah, just great people.
And then Don Sweeney was that old fucking dink
who wouldn't give you the time of day,
wouldn't even talk to you, like, get out of my way.
That's my weight rack. I'm like, all right, this guy's a fucking nerd yeah yeah he's fucking harvard
nerd have a dick but yeah i suck at harvard yeah it's being plot final coming up next week i thought
i mean so in summary i thought people cried a little too much the fact oh it's in the parade
they're trying to sneak a pie i was like well you know they got to do this at some point but
like i said the half of the press commons during the parade when the media wasn't there, that was weak.
And then to say they wanted to get
it out of the way and to take the questions,
he could have done the same fucking thing three hours
later. Do you think
the Bruins team is going to be any
different?
You know what? I think we might see
a little more energy out of this team.
Let's go back to Claude, too. Claude was
a great coach, and we've said this a million times.
Like, you know, everyone's, oh, you're not going to find a better coach than him.
And I agree.
You're not.
But like I always say, maybe right now somebody is a better fit for this team.
I mean, you played.
I think it was time.
I think it was time.
Yeah, you played.
I mean, 10 years is a fucking lifetime in the NHL, Ryan.
I mean, you've got to be.
Thank you.
You've got to imagine that, you know, guys in that team.
No, you can get some new energy. You can be like, oh, on that team, whether they like them or not.
You can get some new energy.
You can be like, oh, just new practices.
Right, exactly.
It's true.
But I'm just saying their team is still the same roster.
It's the same roster.
And I don't think they're going to make the playoffs.
Unless something changes big time.
They have the worst backup goalie situation in the history of the NHL, I think.
They could get a lottery pick, guys, if you think about it.
Oh, Grinnell's taking a dock here.
If you think about it, so they have four games in the next 12 days.
Every team has at least two games in hand on them.
So those teams will be even pretty soon.
The Tampa Bay Lightning are in last place.
Is that who's in last place in the Eastern Conference?
Or the Red Wings.
And they're only, what, six points below the Bruins?
No, I know.
That whole entire Eastern Conference.
The whole Eastern Conference is so close.
Besides, Washington right now is so nasty.
You know, Washington has, since November 18th,
Washington has more shutouts than the Avalanche have wins.
And I think they scored like five goals.
Washington has nine shutouts since November 18th,
and Colorado has eight wins.
Wow.
And I wouldn't be surprised if you see Fode go to Colorado.
Hey, how about Brett Conley?
Do you see him from Washington?
Yeah.
Top pick, 2010, sixth overall.
He had a lot of injury problems in Tampa.
Then he comes to Boston, terrible.
Now he's in Washington.
He looks unbelievable.
People said to me, I call him a stiff online because I thought he was a stiff.
People like this.
He was a stiff.
People like, oh, it was the system.
I was a stiff.
It was the system.
It was clothes fall.
No, he was a stiff.
Listen, I don't give a fuck what system you play. If you're on a line with Bergeron
and Marchand, then you can't score
10 goals. You're a fucking stiff.
Yeah, you could be playing for
Tikhanov in Russia. You should be able to score.
Seriously, there's no... He was putting it
in the goalie's chest every single time.
But I just love how people, like the Bruin
fan mentality of a lot of people, they
blame Claude because Brett Conley sucked.
Like, Claude's system. It's like, explain to me how.
Oh, because he wasn't fast enough to keep up on the wins with the D.
It's like, no, he was a stiff.
Did you watch the guy?
He wasn't behind the play every time.
I think that maybe systems can affect certain people for sure.
You can be bad on one team and great on another.
Right.
But you look at the talent in Washington, and he's playing like third and fourth line role,
and he's not a first line player. Right. So, yeah, what you're saying is you saw him and fourth line role, and he's not a first line player.
So yeah, what you're saying is you saw him in first line role, and he wasn't good at it.
But he can go to a team where they're so good that he's third and fourth line,
and all of a sudden, holy shit, this team doesn't have the expectations.
And that's why you can't blame coaches all the time when players don't play well.
It did happen with Claude all the time.
Going back to Claude just quickly, because there's so much going on around the league. This time of year is great. Football's over. It did happen with Claude all the time. Going back to Claude just quickly,
because there's so much going on around the league.
This time of year is great.
Football's over.
It's awesome.
It's my favorite.
But Claude, he's the best coach in Bruins history.
Yeah, no doubt about it.
Ten years, man.
A Stanley Cup final, they should have gone game seven.
President's trophy. President's trophy.
And then four or five years when they were.
Turn the franchise around when you think about it.
Absolutely.
They sucked before him.
I mean, he restored the pride to the franchise.
And now, I mean, if you're him, he's going to have the pick of the litter.
All he has to do is sit around for two months,
and then he'll be able to coach whatever team he wants.
Yeah, I was wondering.
So you're looking at the Islanders and Doug Waite.
He's the assistant GM, and he's the head coach right now. wants. Yeah, I was wondering. So you're looking at the Islanders and Doug Waits.
He's the assistant GM and he's the head coach right now.
And they've been doing great.
They're 6-2-1 and they're 9 with him.
Maybe the Islanders who are behind the Bruins are like,
let's try to hire Claude and then have him fucking run right by his old team.
You could just see that, right?
But I don't think he's going to be in that much of a rush.
He might be like, I'm going to wait until next year.
Because there will be firings this summer possibly. Yeah, if he's got to be in that much of a rush. He might be like, I'm going to wait until next year because there will be firings this summer possibly.
Yeah, if he's got his eye on a certain team or whatever.
I know Vegas is starting up.
I don't know if he wants to take on an expansion role. But worth noting, former media relations staff, Eric Tosi, who is, I believe, the number two guy in the media relations.
He runs the Vegas office now, Vegas Media Relations.
Not that that's going to entice a coach, but there's a connection there.
There's a familiarity.
Claude and Tosi, they worked with each other for six or seven years.
Just something that, you know.
He's like, yeah, I'll come coach.
You know what I don't want to do in an interview.
Something to consider.
That's all.
Colorado's a team too.
Connection there.
I think Claude could end up in Colorado as well.
Yeah, there's a lot of places that he could end up.
I just checked out the standings when you were talking about last place.
Tampa is in last place, which is ridiculous.
I don't understand how that's possible.
Well, no, Tampa was.
They worked the Blackhawks last night, didn't they?
Yeah, but Tampa has had so many injuries, but they still just, I mean,
John Cooper, I don't think he'll be fired this year,
but if they don't make the playoffs, he could be gone.
Yeah, I mean, and you look, I mean, wow, I can't believe they're at the bottom of the conference.
Which is weird, but they have had a lot of injuries.
Maybe they kind of blame that more.
And there's still only five points back.
I mean, you do look at the East, and some of the teams.
It's so close.
All these teams you think would be dead, like Detroit, Buffalo, Carolina.
I mean, they're four or five points now.
It's really hard to leapfrog six or seven teams there,
but this thing is going to be a race until the end.
Yeah, this will be a season where, do you remember Philly Rangers game 82?
Winner went to the playoffs and went to a shootout.
That was awesome.
I'd love to see a game.
If you can get an 82-game season to go to that last game for a playoff spot
with those two teams playing each other, that's ideal.
That's what everyone's rooting for.
I just think that Montreal's kind of come back to life a little bit.
Price hasn't been as good as he was to start the year.
So you just see teams that you thought were just going to be elite
at the top of the standings all season are just kind of coming back.
And there's just so much parity in the East.
And out West, I mean.
Dude, Dallas style.
Nashville's sneaky, like playing really good.
I think Nashville, if they got into the playoffs, nobody wants to play them.
Absolutely not.
With Pecorine and the guys they have.
But Minnesota has somehow stayed where they are.
I don't even understand how it's.
Bruce Boudreaux is just a regular season coaching legend.
Dubnik, man.
I mean, his numbers are unbelievable.
I mean, he's been fucking phenomenal.
He's the reason why they're doing it.
And they're actually scoring some goals, too.
Minnesota was never a big goal-scoring team,
but I think they're second or third in the league right now,
and that's a place they've never been.
They're actually putting the puck on the net.
Putting the puck in the net.
The biggest disappointment to me, I would say, league overall, and I don't even...
That's awful.
Holy shit.
I'm not really surprised.
I mean, other people might be as Dallas.
They're who I thought they were with those two goaltenders.
Yeah, you called that.
They're seven points back of the eighth seed out west.
They do have a couple games in hand,
but I don't think they're going to get in the playoffs.
It's funny, right?
If I can sit here and we can sit here and determine that Dallas' goaltending sucks,
they're not going to get them anywhere,
then how the fuck does their front office not realize it?
Yeah, and everyone said it before the year.
They fool themselves into thinking that all of a sudden,
Niemi and fucking the other one fucking letting in,
all of a sudden they're going to be good enough.
You wonder if that happens.
Because sometimes it's  I think fans are way more often wrong
than they are right in calling preseason predictions.
No offense to you.
But if in an instant like this where everyone said it
and they didn't at least catch on a little and be like,
all right, well, maybe we could make a trade, do something.
Because they're both making money, too.
They both get paid, too.
That's the thing.
And I think they thought, oh, we're just going to outscore teams.
And then that hasn't happened.
No, no.
I mean, Jim Neal said the other day that their best players haven't been
as good as they thought they were going to be this season. They've had off years so when that happens and like hemski's out they lose team
speed speed and it's just it's just a weird team like you need sagan to be getting like 40 50 goals
which he still probably could the way that guy gets goes on streaks but i i would i don't see
how they get in right now i don't but i st St. Louis is interesting, which, by the way, they fired Hitchcock.
He was three games away.
I'm sorry.
Three wins away from tying second most all-time in coaching wins.
No, he was one game away from tying Al Arbor for third all-time,
and he was two away from becoming third all-time by himself in coaching wins. They've got to be pretty pissed they guaranteed Mike Yeo that job
because there are some pretty good coaches that are going on the market.
Coach Julian would be a perfect fit there.
Yeah, I mean, they have a similar style team to the Bruins.
Mike Yeo, he's a good coach.
I had him for a long time.
He's my assistant in Wilkes-Barre and Pittsburgh.
I mean, I don't know really kind of how things went for him in Minnesota because I never talked to guys to you know if they enjoyed
playing for him because guys change so much from head coach assistant to head it's it sucks when
it happens because you're like the assistant coach is your buddy you know you can kind of shoot the
shit with him and then he has to just change his role and he can't be like buddy buddy with people
and you're like oh fuck this I lost my buddy assistant coach that I could kind of speak more openly to,
and he would talk to you more openly, like this is what we're thinking.
You know, you don't have like the hard-ass head coach, you know, right in your ear.
But I think that guys respect you all, and, I mean, they just needed a new voice.
That was a similar thing to Julian.
They just kind of  it had been a long time,
and I think that Hitchcock wears on guys a little sooner than Claude did as well.
Yeah, yeah, Claude  Hitchcock can be  Yeah, he can be a think that Hitchcock wears on guys a little sooner than Claude did as well. Yeah, yeah.
Hitchcock can be hard on guys.
Claude wasn't as grating, I don't think, as Hitchcock was.
But as far as like, Jesus Christ, Shaddy.
Question about his record, though.
I mean, yeah, you don't keep a coach around.
When your team is floundering like the Blues were, you've got to fire a guy.
When the team's not playing and the goaltenders are playing terrible,
they had to do something.
You're not going to say, oh, well, he's three wins away from a record.
That could take 15 games to get that record.
Yeah, I mean, that's like Claude.
I mean, we knew it was going to happen.
When it happens, people say it was the wrong decision,
but it was just time for both sides to move on.
All right, thoughts on, in both of you guys, thoughts on Bruce Cassidy.
Who the hell is this guy?
I've heard bad things.
No, I've heard that.
Good things in the NHL.
I've heard pretty good things, actually, that he, I mean,
last time he was the head coach in the NHL, what was he, 2004?
2002, 2003, I think I saw.
That's a long time.
Did he go out on bad terms?
I think there was some negativity with him and the players.
Yeah, well, basically he failed as a coach in Washington.
Yeah, exactly.
He wasn't ready to be a head coach.
Right.
15 years later, he could be.
He said that.
He acknowledged that.
Like Mike Sullivan.
He was only 37.
Josh McDaniels, he'll be a head coach someday, and he failed as a head coach.
Hell yeah.
Football guys, too.
I think you're right, Mike.
We don't know a lot about him.
His NHL record one season, he acknowledged he was probably not ready for it.
He was 37 years old, which is kind of ironic.
The season he coached them, they bottomed out,
and they ended up getting Ovechkin in the draft after the season he coached them.
They're like, thank you.
Thank you for coaching us shittily.
But what I've read about him, I think it's Mark Diva,
he covers the Providence Bruins.
He's a real good writer.
He's awesome.
Yeah, he seems like a pretty good guy.
I haven't actually met him in person.
But he has great things to say about Cassie.
He knows the game well.
He was pretty successful in Providence getting things done.
I think the Bruins are going to give him a shot.
They didn't name him coach.
He basically has an audition right now.
He's kind of test driving the franchise.
If he does good, they'll give him a deal.
If he still shows he's not
an NHL caliber coach, then they're not
committed to him beyond this year.
Basically an enormous
three months in this guy's life.
Yeah, exactly.
His team is determining his future.
Exactly.
Enormous.
Is it monetary terms?
Is that the right word?
Monetary.
Yeah, I mean, his whole career is kind of, you know,
this next few months is going to shift the dynamic of his career.
If it's good, he'll probably be back in the fall.
And if it's not, then, you know, he'll stay in hockey.
But his career as a potential NHL
head coach could disappear if he has a shitty uh a shitty time here so yeah man it's definitely
a coin flip I mean we don't know what we're gonna get uh I do expect to see the a little bit more
of an emotional engagement from the Bruins though just because again you know Claude yeah he didn't
have the pots here but he you know there were too many nights that team was just slow starting.
They just weren't, you know, games that mattered.
Games like that.
I was on this game a few weeks ago, a Monday night game, and they didn't even show up.
Toronto shit kicked them in their building.
Yeah.
Like, that was it.
Spanked them.
Yeah.
Do we have any good all-right Hamiltons?
Oh, yeah.
We got a couple of good ones.
A couple of viewer questions.
Because I figure we might have some questions coming in this week.
All right.
How does it feel to root for the Patriots?
Of course.
So, well, Angry Mike asks,
All right, Hamilton, has there been an altercation in the locker room at the All-Star game?
I can imagine Nielsen wanted to kill Marshy after a slew fit.
All right, how?
No, that would  I couldn't picture that ever happening.
But, I mean, and he didn't slew foot Nielsen.
He slew foot at Cronwall.
Yeah.
So, like, yeah.
Yeah.
He was probably like, what's up, Marci?
How you doing, buddy?
Like, there's no  I mean, unless he  someone maybe did something really dirty to somebody else that was in the game.
But you'd be an absolute donkey if you started going at some guy in the locker room.
Generally speaking, Ryan, what happens on the ice stays in the ice.
I mean, you know, right?
I mean, guys don't typically.
Yeah, unless you're fucking Marty McSorley like somebody in the side of the dome piece.
Like, yeah, I mean, a little, a swoop foot like that isn't going to get anything going in the All-Star game.
They're like, where are we going tonight?
Right.
I mean, you know, and you've got guys who've punched the shit out of each other and fought each other plenty of times.
And they hang out and have beers together and shoot the shit.
Yeah, I don't think that stuff doesn't drag on.
Good question, though.
All right, Chris Passarelli wants to know,
where do the Islanders go now that the Barclays is effectively kicking them out?
And I want to add on to this.
I don't know if you guys heard, but the Hartford, the governor of Hartford,
Connecticut, wrote a letter to the Islanders
trying to bring the Whalers back.
Never.
People with us bring the Whalers back.
Let it the fuck go.
Have you been to Hartford?
Let it go.
Hartford's a shithole.
Exactly.
Hartford is where you stop the piss on the way from New York to Boston
or vice versa.
Or it's for kids who go to Trinity and just get buckled all the time.
Yeah, that too.
But fucking get over it, Hartford.
You're never getting the Whalers back.
They're never going to be Hartford Whalers in the NHL again.
Move on.
Forget about it.
It's done.
Just don't ever delete the song that they played.
You'll be better off staying in a fucking lively whaling industry again in New England
before you see the fucking Hartford Whalers again.
Good question.
All right.
So Sean.
That's two for two. I'm fucking caffeined out the yeah i know i
can tell i'm shocked so uh sean matthew wants to know uh and this kind of goes back to the coaches
with all these great coaches who's getting las vegas out of all the fired coaches who's getting
a new team first so we kind of slipped two in there uh so he thinks first what's the second
one that he wants to know what city's getting getting a new team? Out of all the fired
coaches, who's getting a new team
first? Probably Grant, Hitchcock,
Julian.
I don't know.
Julian might say no to somebody.
I think that if any team could
hire a guy first, it'd probably be Julian.
I don't see how you could...
I don't think Hitchcock
was going to... Was Hitchcock was going to.
I'm sensing.
That's what I wonder.
Was Hitchcock getting fired or was he retiring?
He was retiring at the end of the year, but they were kind of pushing him out.
Okay, so I'm wondering.
Hitchcock could get a job first, but I don't know if he wants to coach.
I don't know if he still wants to coach, but you can't guess because GMs just might want a younger coach
that's come from their AHL affiliate if they're going to have one.
If I'm Julian, I'd take the year off.
Hitch will probably check in with The Undertaker first,
because if they're going to bring Paul Bearer back,
you want to make sure that everything's lined up first.
He really did look just like Paul fucking Bearer.
Oh, I rented the Royal Rumble a couple weeks ago.
It was awesome.
Gambled on it.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Gambled on it.
It was unbelievable.
You have a girlfriend?
Dan, watch wrestling. She wasn't home. Wow't you have a girlfriend? Gambled on it. It's unbelievable. You have a girlfriend? Dan, watch wrestling.
She wasn't home.
Wow.
Stereotypes are great every day.
All right, we got one more.
Hamilton?
Yeah, we have two more.
Cool.
But, yeah, we'll go two more.
All righty.
So, Brandon Shaw says, what do you guys think of the new pants goalies need to wear?
Have you noticed a difference at all?
I haven't noticed a difference.
I read about it.
I probably couldn't tell, like, a negligible difference looking at it.
But anything that makes the goalie equipment smaller is good with me.
You watch highlights from 30 years ago, and these guys look fucking naked compared to now.
I mean, they've got the old horse hats.
They're wrapping like old Boston Globes around their shins.
Yeah, the old horse head pads with the fucking waffle.
It's about the size of a waffle nowadays.
And you look at these guys now now and way too much equipment.
I mean, they eat up the whole net.
And it's not messing with the history of the game.
If you can keep them safe, if you can keep them safe, then, yeah, shrink everything.
Those pants, the only people I've heard complaining are goalies are flipping out.
But, like, the rules now are, like, if you get in trouble, it's a huge fine for you.
Your equipment manager gets fined.
I don't know if it's a suspension.
I doubt it.
I should probably check on that.
Grinelli, maybe if you can look that up.
But I don't even think at all that any player is going to, like, feel bad for goalies.
They look  you can't see net.
It's like Vladikov, the goalie.
Remember that commercial with the fat guy that would just back into the net
and then there was nothing to shoot at?
It was like turning into, they would be coming out
and taking their angle. You couldn't see any net.
You want more
goals, that's the first thing you do.
The goalie equipment has gotten ridiculous.
It's nice to see they're finally scaling back on it.
They're good enough already.
Go ahead, one more. Besides Mike Condon, I heard Mike
Condon listens to our show.
He's having a hell of a year.
Mike, keep it up.
Shout out to the Massachusetts guy.
Yeah.
So you can keep wearing the old goalie pads.
So Jerry, hashtag CuckJerry, asks, black or white tape, thoughts, concerns, conspiracies,
and how do you feel about Kessel rocking the candy cane?
All right, Hamilton. Kessel's been, he's been in games? Yeah, feel about Kessel rocking the candy cane? All right, Hamilton.
Kessel's been, he's been in games?
Yeah, he's always rocked the candy cane.
Oh, wait.
On a tape job?
On the stick.
The candy cane's a tape.
Yeah, but he doesn't, yeah, but he doesn't use two different colors.
No, no, no, no.
The candy cane's just when you just tape, you just wrap it like kind of arm around.
This must be new age hockey.
Should have never heard of the candy cane.
That's a terrible look.
I don't give a fuck if you're Phil Kessel.
That's awful.
Cover the whole blade.
You don't have to cover the whole blade, but you have to cover tape.
You can't leave like blades showing in between.
I always use white tape.
I don't know why, actually.
Black tape I used when I was little, and then I changed to white and never went back.
I really have no reason why.
People who say that black tape hides the puck more,
that's the biggest bullshit I've ever heard.
Black tape doesn't hide shit.
I used to do black tape,
and then I'd spray paint the bottom of my stick black.
Oh, really?
And it's just such a hard-o move.
You were such a hard-o, I bet.
Such a hard-o.
I respect that.
Yeah, I had to do it.
You must have had headphones on getting ready for every game, right?
No, no, no.
I was a locker room guy.
Okay, okay.
My coach told me he picked me because I was a locker room guy at first.
Were you trying to hit the glass in all shots and warm-ups in high school?
Oh, yeah.
100.
100.
I love it.
I love it, Mikey.
I love it.
As far as black tape, white tape, I don't know.
All tape matters.
Oh!
Ba-dum-bum!
Caught that one late.
No, good questions.
People keep sending them in for All Right Hamilton.
One little problem we're getting with the All Right Hamiltons is,
is it All Right Hamilton or All Right Hamilton?
Well, that's funny, because I actually...
Why don't we just write, like...
Because we're getting both hashtags.
It's funny you mention this,
because when I actually had my...
Why don't we do a spit and check with question or something?
When I had the t-shirts made up, I actually
looked up the script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High
to find out how it was spelled in the script.
That's how fucking...
How nerdy you were.
On the script, it was all right, like, A, because you can actually, if you were writing
like a paper, you could actually do it the one word version, A-L-R-I-G-H-T, or you could
do it the two words, A-L-L space R-I-G-H-T.
This shouldn't be this confusing.
I know.
People are getting wet right now listening to this shit.
We sound like muffins.
So on the hashtag, obviously a hashtag, there's no spaces.
So hashtag is A-L-L, capital R-I-G-H-T, capital H, Hamilton.
So all right, Hamilton.
Does it have to be capital?
Well, I mean, no, because it's going to show up.
I'm just saying he's asking for the preferred nomenclature, so I'm giving it to him.
But if you fucking...
Donnie, shut the fuck up!
You are yellamant!
So, yeah, you know, it...
The movie's on the other day.
Oh, it's been on every...
I've watched the most 17 fucking times this month.
The more I watch it, the more I want to watch it again.
The movie is fucking great.
So, yeah, basically, as long as they fucking include
the stool chicklets hashtag and they spell it
in some variation of All Right Hamilton,
we should get the question.
So don't be peck-aheads. of All Right Hamilton, we should get the question.
So don't be pack of heads.
Include the hashtag and we'll get your questions.

So, alright, that's good for the
alright Hamilton. Guys,
Oscars in a week and a half,
I ain't seen shit, man. I've seen
one fucking movie. I've seen
hella high water. You could get invited to the Oscars
talking like that. You would just, imagine
R.A. speaking at the Oscars. You should be
what's it called? MC in that? Oh, God. Imagine you're already speaking at the Oscars. You should be a, what's it called, MC in that.
Oh, God.
I wonder how you'd do. People would just be
shocked when you came out there. They would need to
fucking translate it. You'd have like a Patriots
sweatshirt on, a Bruins hat.
So listen, you fucking tucks, alright?
I haven't seen, I haven't,
I mean, I don't even really, I can't even
talk about it. I don't know what's up. I don't know what's up
for Oscars.
I saw Manchester by the Sea.
That was sad and depressing.
Don't say too much about it because I haven't seen it yet.
I don't know.
What else?
Oh, the one movie that we talked about, I think, before that's sick is with Chris Pine.
Oh, High Water.
That movie was unbelievable.
And I'm embarrassed.
People have been liking The Fall, too.
I gave people The Fall.
I see a lot of tweets. On Netflix. And I'm embarrassed of myself. People have been liking the fall, too. I gave people the fall. I see a lot of tweets.
On Netflix.
Yeah, I'm still embarrassed.
I've seen one of the best picture nominees.
It's just my work schedule.
I haven't had time to get to the show.
Not to mention, my guy who gets me my screeners, I haven't been in touch with.
Wink, wink.
Legit screeners to watch the movie.
So, yeah, I'm way fucking behind.
Usually, I have nine million things to recommend, but I just haven't fucking been watching shit.
Yeah.
Football, hockey, everything.
The sports have been tying up my social aspect a little bit too much.
Now we're just on hockey, though.
There's no more.
No, well, this is the time right now.
I mean, football's all over.
Oh, and the NBA.
The focus goes to, well, hockey fans are all into hockey.
Hoop fans are all into hoop.
And by the way, like, Twitter loves fucking dunks, man.
I mean, like, how many fucking ways?
It's not even hard
for them. Yeah, yeah. It's like, yeah.
You just jump up. You don't even have to
jump some of them. It's like going, it would be like
showing, like, flicking it into the top shelf
of an empty net. Yeah, it's like,
oh, here, look at this dunk. And I'm like, oh,
he ran and jumped because he's 7 feet
fucking 260. 7 foot tall, dumped the fucking
on a 10 foot net. I don't know. What a shocking thing.
We're being stereotypical hockey guys right now, shitting on basketball.
What's up, Grinnelli?
This is our 60 seconds.
Yeah, what do you got in your mind, Grinnelli?
Nothing.
No, no.
Okay, so you were looking to chime in.
No, no, no.
So what else is good about Houston, Grinnelli?
I mean, here it's a gigantic, laid-out city that it takes like an hour just to get from
the southeast of Dorchester.
Spent a lot of money on Ubers because you're basically everywhere.
It's basically a 15-minute Uber.
The downtown was awesome, though.
And, I mean, the Barstool party was the best night of my life.
I mean, that was unbelievable.
It did look pretty sick.
I mean, I wanted to go.
People were like, oh, how come you didn't go?
I'm like, well, I wasn't going to go all the way to Houston without a ticket for the game.
I mean, you know, I'm 44 years old.
I'm not flying 4,000 miles collectively for a fucking party, you know, unless
it's like the Playboy Mansion.
It probably looks better than the Playboy Mansion,
didn't it, Mikey? Yeah, a lot of guys were asking about you,
but yeah, I mean, the girls were
unbelievable, to say
the least. Barstool is just
water's hot for the female demo.
The girl, I mean, because
there's so many famous athletes there.
Were you more trying to talk to the Barstool guys or girls?
The Barstool guys?
No, no.
Yeah.
No, I mean, the Barstool guys were the least famous guys there.
I mean, Tony Romo was there.
You know, you have all these football players.
Johnny Football was there.
Johnny Football was there.
You have...
Sean Thorough.
Were there any famous actresses there?
I saw a lot of dudes.
Were there any, was there any, like, hot chick, famous hot chicks there? I saw a lot of dudes. Was there any famous hot chicks there?
I don't know about famous.
I know Sidney Esiason was there.
I think she's pretty famous.
Who?
Sidney Esiason.
Natty Mantish.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She's a big stoolie.
She's a big friend of the program.
There was just a ton of...
Boomer's daughter, right?
A ton of Barstool smoke shows there.
It was like everywhere you...
You must have just been loving life, Grinnells.
Were you smashed?
I was so drunk.
It was ridiculous.
What happened with your phone?
I saw you tweeting up a storm.
Mikey Grinnelli, you see this?
He went after Apple as hard as you can go after someone on the internet.
He messaged me on Twitter and said,
if you want to pursue legal battles, here's our attorney's email.
Oh, I thought they were going to say they got in touch with you to help you.
No.
Oh, no, no, no.
They're like, yo, bitch, try suing us.
So I was at a bar, and I plugged my phone into an outlet, and it erased everything on my phone.
It wiped out my phone.
Just plugging it in.
Just plugged it in, and it erased everything.
Just wiped it out.
I shut it off. I plugged it in and it erased everything. Just wiped it out. I shut it off.
I shut it off to charge.
And when I came back to turn it on, it was like I was getting a new phone.
That's so weird.
And the worst part was...
You just got some good drama.
I was wheeling abroad.
And I had just spent probably three or four, probably three and a half hours.
Because we were there the whole day.
Really laying the groundwork.
Talking. She introduced me to her mom, her dad, her three older brothers, all in the military. Probably three and a half hours. Because we were there the whole day. Really laying the groundwork.
Talking.
She introduced me to her mom, her dad, her three older brothers, all in the military, might I say.
I respect them.
So I spent so much time meeting her family.
I'm like, I'm going to go plug my phone in.
I'll be right back.
And then I'm going to just go to work. I plug my phone in and it gets erased.
I can't find her for the rest of the night.
She must think you're a piece of shit.
I hit her up.
There we go.
So you got everything back, though.
I got everything back.
From the cloud.
That's why I was wondering why you were flipping.
Well, no, I don't back it up to the cloud.
So it wasn't the cloud.
So I went to Apple and great service.
They told me 35 minutes.
I was like, you know, I'm going to the Super Bowl today.
If you could get me in any quicker, I'd really appreciate it.
Oh, no problem.
We'll squeeze you in right away.
Houston's awesome.
They're great down there.
So they squeezed me in, and some guy plugs in.
He said he's going to do some, like, mechanical groundwork on it.
Got it all back.
Got it all back.
Even to, like, all the text messages I missed and everything.
So that picture you had of Ravel send nudes, did you make the text messages I missed and everything. That picture you had of
Ravel send nudes, did you make that sign?
I did not.
Did you see the picture of that Ravel?
I was standing next to...
First off, the rundown was amazing.
That was at the rundown.
Some guy came up to me and he's like...
I had been talking to him for a little bit.
He's like, yo, Darren Ravel's over there.
I heard he's sneaking around back and he doesn't want to be seen.
And I'm like, no way.
No way.
He's like, where is he?
So I tweet out, someone tells me Darren Revelle's here.
So I tweet out, and then I go over, and I see him.
And I see some kid with a Revelle send nude sign.
And I'm like, yo, can I use this for the picture?
And Revelle was like, got to be I use this for the picture? Ravel was like, gotta be a good
sport about this, man. Absolutely.
Had to see what this is all about. He was awesome.
Yeah, he definitely, I mean, I know people
goof on him, and he seems like a bit of a squid, but
you know what? He is a team player as far as
letting goofed on and taking a picture
with you.
He knows he's a complete geek,
and he just lives lives it yeah he
he he he he owns it i mean at least you can respect the guy i mean there's not there's
nothing phony about it you know what i mean like i mean i've you know i i i understand the
criticisms of the guy he's definitely like kind of a corporate show for a lot of companies yeah
whether inadvertently or not but you know a guy who can sit there and take his licks i you know
i can have a little bit of respect for a guy like that. So, yeah, it was a pretty big week for fucking, for Barstool.
They ran the Super Bowl. I mean, everywhere you
go, they ran, I mean,
everyone you talk to was
Barstool Sports, Barstool Sports. I mean,
before the Barstool Party, everyone that day
you talk to, you go to the Barstool Party tonight
and then, I mean, I work
at WHDH 7 News in Boston
and I go back to work yesterday
and they're all like, holy shit, Barstool ran the show down there.
When they got banned from Super Bowl Radio Row,
that was the best thing that's ever happened to the company.
And they still got in.
And they still got in was the best part.
Yeah, when all Goodell, like actually last night,
PFT and Big Cat appeared on SVP Sports Center last night.
They've taken over.
PFT admitted, said as much, that when Goodell, when they got asked at the press conference,
and kudos to the guy who asked it, all he did was make them more popular by banning them,
by telling you you can't do it, or they're not here, by pretending they didn't exist,
all that was introduced to Brandon.
And the fact they snuck in.
Throw gas on the fire.
Oh, it was hilarious.
And then they sit outside, and they get all these people coming.
They're still interviewing them.
And, you know, it's just great when people are kind of, like, giving the finger to the NFL, you know.
It's good shit to see.
So, anything, any other?
Oh, we had this today in NHL history, right?
Yeah, today in NHL history, Scotty Bowman.
No.
Legend.
Scotty's done nothing to me.
Legend. Scotty's done nothing in the league. Legend.
He earned his 1,000th NHL win
in 1997 for the Detroit Red Wings.
They had a wagon then.
Those teams were so filthy.
Last team to repeat. Filthy. Federov,
Larionov, Lidstrom.
Those teams
were... Those were my favorite.
I bought an Iserman
away red Red Wings jersey when I was like 12.
I got it for Christmas.
Best gift ever.
He's one guy.
He's probably my number one player that I always wish was a Bruin and never have.
He would have been such a fucking fit here.
Brendan Shanahan in Boston.
I know, but Brendan Shanahan in Boston.
A fucking name like that.
And then in 2003, Mario Lemieux became the 10th player to accumulate 1,000 career assists.
Wow.
No big deal.
Wow.
And that's pretty ironic because Crosby's now two points away from 1,000.
You cannot not mention that.
I think it's 998 points now in 772 games.
That's Crosby?
Yeah.
Not too bad.
Not too shabby.
I believe it's top eight in points per game all time.
I think maybe top five even.
So you've got to respect that kid.
Or at least I have to.
I know.
He's amazing.
Good in the car.
I show when he drops.
Well, probably like late Thursday, early Friday.
But we only won an NHL game tonight on Wednesday night.
Yeah.
Slow night.
Slow night.
But then Thursday.
The bye week's coming up too, don't Thursday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, yeah.
Well, the Bruins have theirs coming up.
These bye weeks are like...
So I love them.
I love them.
Coaches hate them because the team...
Well, because it creates an imbalance
of how many games you've played.
And I know it all comes down to the wash.
No, I'm saying because guys are away
and they're just like drinking and chilling.
That's what coaches do.
Oh, okay.
I think coaches get the break too.
But if they  so not like GMs are complaining about it and the NHL is complaining about it.
Well, just add three days to Christmas and three days to the All-Star break.
That's the six days.
Did you read the same tweet I did?
No.
No, it's funny.
I took the words out of my mouth.
I was reading  I don't know if it was a LeBron article, but someone said that.
I don't know if it was a GM said, look, instead of giving a team five days off randomly,
like every team is getting these random five days off.
And it's caused, like the Bruins have played way more games than anybody.
And if you do, like you just said, add three games at the break.
I'm sorry, three days at the Christmas break, three days at the All-Star break.
And then, you know, everybody gets that rest and everybody's on the same page schedule-wise,
and you don't have teams playing five, six more games than another team.
Because that throws everything at the table.
But it's awesome for players.
I saw a couple of Snapchats from guys I know, just big-ass drinks in Cancun.
I might have to get on Instagram just so I know who to bet against when they come back.
Oh, these guys were slurping down fucking tacos two days ago.
Give me a fucking puck line. Give me fucking Huck Klein.
Give me for a dime.
Crosby's 998 points in 753 games.
Hockey?
137 points in 124 playoff games.
I don't trust HockeyDB as 100.
I trust Hockey to be 100.
Yeah, Hockey Reference I like a little bit better than HockeyDB.
I think this is easier to read than Hockey Reference.
They're both great.
Hockey Reference has more.
Yeah.
But these are updated from
the night before. Right, and it's all pictures.
There's not even any words there.
What's that? You pulled... Oh, no.
So, alright, any other notes
you want to add? Any suggestions, things,
tips, various recipes? No, I mean,
I'll be back at...
I'll be up in Toronto later next week
at NHL Network the week after that,
so there'll be more of, if you do
want to catch me maybe on TV in Canada.
The other thing too, we'll talk about this
off camera.
We got a plan now, a week down
or a couple days down headquarters.
We're definitely coming down. Me and Grinnell
are going to probably drive down someday. You're down
in New York. Jersey. Okay. Jersey.
You're there for like a Wednesday.
A night that I have to work later at night we'll do go during the day. Yeah, when you're out there for like a Wednesday. A night that I have to work at like later at night, we'll do go during the day.
Yeah, when you're out there for a couple nights, we'll come down.
We'll scoop you and say caucus.
Yeah.
Caucus.
So, yeah.
So, that'll wrap it up.
Again, thanks for bearing with our Boston-centric show this week.
But, you know, obviously, it was a big Super Bowl.
Claude got fired.
We kind of had to talk about it.
So, we're winners.
We have to do it.
Yeah, we got to do it. It's a Boston
show. Once in a while, we got to do a little extra
Boston. Today was one of those.
Everybody, I'm sure, made it out fine.
Alright, that'll
wrap it up for today's episode.
Yeah, we'll get an interview for next week.
Yeah, today we really... Maybe throw in some people
you'd like us to try to get.
Actually, yeah, someone mentioned...
I want to try to get Bobby.
I want to try to get Bob Yeah. Send us some connections. Yeah, actually, yeah. Someone mentioned that. I know. Wow. I want to try to get Bobby. I want to try to get Bobby Little.
I want to try to get Bob McKenzie.
Sean Thornton.
Sean.
Roberto.
If anyone runs into these guys, tell them we need them.
So, all right.
So, yeah.
Shoot us out any requests from guys who want to try to get us on the show.
And we'll see you on Twitter.
Take care, everybody.
We're out.
Peace out. We'll be right back.
