Hey, Spittin' Chicklets listeners, you can find every episode on Apple Podcasts,
Spotify, or YouTube. Prime members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. Hello everybody, welcome to episode 274 of Spittin' Chicklets, presented by Pink Whitney
from our friends at New Amsterdam Vodka here on the Barstool Sports Podcast family.
Even though we're on the once aa-week schedule at no pucks,
we decided to say thank you to everybody who's been sticking by us
during these hockey-free times and dropped a little surprise Monday episode for you.
Hopefully everybody digs it, but let's say hi to the gang first,
producer Mikey Grinelli, dressed in pink like a couple of people here.
Gentlemen, you guys look fantastic.
R.A., biz, guys look great.
Don't know if I can say the same about Whitney.
He's not in his pink-white sweatshirt.
But, guys, I'm doing great right now.
Got a little sunburn, and I'm ready to go today.
Nice.
I got a little color, too.
You can't really tell.
Next up, Biz Nasty.
We'll go to you, Paul Biss.
Now, we're going to the pink sweatshirt committee first.
We got to describe what's going on here.
I signed on, and G was wearing his pink Whitney tie-dye.

a nice little banister coming here soon i'm not gonna say what it's gonna be a surprise but then

fucking way that that wit's gonna over. But he does have his nice
golf attire. And it is great
to stop by. We love you guys.
You mean more to us than you know.
This gives me
something to look forward to every
week. And now twice a week this week
because it was Witt's great idea that
we needed to treat the fans.
And last but not least,
Ryan Whitney, the W the wit dog what's up
buddy what's going on guys uh so all three of you have mentioned that i don't have the pink
sweatshirt on that there was no memo to wear so you can all fuck right off uh i still am rocking

like maybe my uh olympic or silver medal jersey and metal maybe that'll hang up uh and yeah you
could say second place is for losers but but how many of you have Olympic medals?
So suck on that.
What else is going on?
Yeah, and Biz says this was my idea.
So if you want to hear what really happened,
Biz said, guys, I think we should release an episode Monday.
You know, crazy times.
We had the episode a week or two ago that had to happen.
And I said right away, fuck off, Biz.
Come on.
This is our vacation right now.
There's no hockey.
We're going to be getting rolling.
And he actually laid it out on the line.
He put it down and he proved why he's the leader.
And he said, dude, we're number one.
You want to stay at number one?
You continue to give content to the fans and you never let up and you don't get satisfied.
And I do get satisfied because I got a lot to be satisfied about.
But I appreciate you for being yourself and getting us on here tonight
because now I'm happy that we're shooting the shit.
Play a coach.
Biz Nasty.
No doubt about it.
I got Grinnelli on an Adderall and Red Bull diet.
He doesn't get to sleep because he's got to edit YouTube videos
and fucking get those out too.
Which, by the way, quick plug here.
We just dropped jamal mares
who we had earlier this season in chicago that was when we got uh kirby doc who else duncan teeth
uh who else did we nello ferreira adrian adrian a car geez name dropper watch your toes um and then
about 30 minutes before we jumped on here jvr we got him when we were in philadelphia
when gritty fucking
sprayed me with that shit and ruined my jacket by the way that was a 500 jacket gritty you are a
piece of trash but you know what nhl fan choice awards he didn't win best mascot chance from
vegas did so suck it gritty uh and before we go any further i've said it once i've said it once. I've said it twice, but this is now going to be
Chicklets Meme's best work
in what he did with
R.A.'s beginning last week.
R.A., I'm still convinced
you were on a massive amount
of cocaine.
I know Death Wish Coffee's legit,
but that was the craziest.
When I re-listened,
I actually,
I re-listened to that clip
on memes 15 times
and had tears coming down my...
Because you go from my...
And when you go, my buddy's buddy, buddy,
and then Vince says, oh, you got a buddy?
Well, once you started both interrupting me,
then I was just discombobulated.
Oh, I loved it.
I was getting off the track,
and then I didn't even know what the fuck I was saying anymore.
I don't think...
That was just so good.
And then the work he did, phenomenal.
So I've said phenomenal twice already. saying anymore. That was just so good. And then the work he did, phenomenal. Death Wish was just stroking itself off.
The gist of the real long story
short was basically... No!
I put on a movie. As a result of putting on
a movie, I ended up getting in touch with an old friend
I hadn't talked to in years.
I got the job. That's all.
Great work.
We'll get to the Death Wish a little bit later. How are you doing, R.A.?
It's great to see you.
I'm doing fine, man.
You know, we're still not completely open here in Boston.
I mean, you can go out and hit a couple patios or whatever, but I'm fine.
I get no complaints, brother.
Life is good.
All right, buddy. Life is good.
And we got a doubleheader today for the folks, Biz.
We did an AMA on Twitch about a week and a half ago.
We know some of our listeners might have caught, but not all of you did.
So we're going to drop some of those questions in a little bit.
And we also have Pittsburgh Penguin Patrick Malo as well,
likely a future Hall of Famer.
So we'll be bringing him on a little bit.
What do you got, Biss?
Well, the word memorabilia got brought up.
I think you said it when you mentioned your silver medal wit just now.
And we actually got asked that in that chat.
So this AMA was just the fans jumping
on our twitch stream asking us questions and ra i mean like it looked like you had a blast
yeah it was man well i hadn't i hadn't done any twitch stuff yet so when i jumped on and what was
a little late it was uh it was good i love that shit it's something different i mean we obviously
love talking hockey here but sometimes it's good to mix it up and find out different interest and
funny stories because well i got we all have interesting backgrounds oh absolutely i mean i got put on the spot because i ended up mentioning
all this memorabilia that assembled like through winning things and then you realize although wit
made all the money on this podcast he's a fucking loser he didn't have one trophy is you you you
have three sticks in your ghetto fucking office that you're in right now and they were the three
sticks you used like your whole seven year pro career because you never broke sticks because you never oh i love it i love you
are you are in a mood today i love it take it out take it out of my head space right now okay
actually before we get to the ama i gotta ask you about uh i noticed jordan speith was in the
running this week it looked like he found his game a little bit and i know that he was a big name in
golf that kind of fallen off a little
bit.
Yeah.
He did tough final round,
but I'll more importantly,
I'll talk about my golf for a second.
I have been playing the best golf of my life.
No doubt about it.
The last three weeks,
like I'm down to a legit 0.0.
Are you shitting me now?
Can I play to that every day?
I don't think so,
but it's good timing because
tomorrow morning, which will be Monday, I have a tea
time to get to the Mass Am. You remember last
year how I got in, so I got the other round
tomorrow or now today when you're listening
to this. Here's the thing. Tough
news. 7.14
AM tea time.
Pardon?
Pardon is right.
I think I'm getting up at 4.30.
And, yeah, you could say I'm crazy, but you know what the thing is?
My body takes two hours to feel normal.
Every morning, you know, these bones, these aches, these pains,
it's tough being me.
And when you put your life and your body on the line for 12 years pro in Sweden, Russia, and North America,
it's like, what are you supposed to do to get ready to play golf besides wake up, maybe go for a little walk?
So we'll see how I play.
Today I hit a couple hooks, but I played on Friday at this beautiful, beautiful golf course in Rhode Island.
Juana Moissett.
Everyone who knows golf knows it.
It's incredible.
So the member, this kid, Josh Padua. Padua, I think I'm saying's it's incredible so the member this kid josh padwa
padwa i think i'm saying it right my friend is buddies with this kid so he uh he brought me
we're on the 12th hole hold on we're on the 12th hole i'm taking a picture this beautiful uphill
par three it's 200 yards unbelievable hole and the member's hitting and he hits a shot right at
the pin he hits a six iron rocket right at the pin.
I'm like that, that fucking thing could, could be in legit throwing right at it.
I step up and I stripe.
I took a little more club.
I had a five iron.
It's right at the pin that could be in, right?
They're both right at the pin.
I bomb up above the green.
There's one ball about three feet away.
And then I look and there's one ball in the hole.
And guess whose it wasn't me.
But congratulations, Josh, the member, his first hole in one at his home track,
won a boy's hit.
An unbelievable shot.
I ran down to him.
He thought he was, he said he thought, he thought I was messing with him.
I'm like, I would never fuck around with that unless I'm talking to my grandfather.
And after that, it was just all downhill.
Him and his partner pounded us, lost like 300, I think.
And it was great to see a hole in one, but I was that close.
I missed the birdie putt, too.
Suck on that, Whit.
So, yeah, that's golf.
Spieth is struggling in the final rounds and on the weekend, Biz.
Well, I was going to hop in there and say it's good to know
I won't be having to carry us in the sandbaggers moving forward considering you found your game you parried us for like four holes in
in one of them yeah no i mean still carried uh in ra before you uh you hop in there maybe the the
usga maybe they're gonna hire that same guy that uh that got hired in happy gilmore you will not
make this putt, you jackass,
because of everything you slandered them about on our podcast.
Wait, who?
Because you said you're going to that tournament tomorrow.
Remember how you complained to the board about
No, no, that was the USGA.
This is the MGA, the Massachusetts
Oh, no, it's Mass Golf Links.
Massachusetts Golf, a little different than the USGA.
Oh, Jesus.
And by the way, I will take all that back.
If all those qualifiers get canceled and the field this year gets into next year,
I take it all back.
Okay.
I didn't know there was different cults.
Yeah, there's different cults.
There's different wagons.
There's different groups.
Oh, it is, Biz.
It's like all the different aspects of your life.
You got your ad department.
You got your decorating of your ghetto office department.
You got your above-ground pool department.
You got your had a goatee for like seven years department.
Oh, my goodness.
You are fucking awesome.
You had a flavor saver for a while.
Buddy, I had it all.
I had all the worst of the fats.
Hey, when I was in grade six already, you know those big-ass Janko jeans?
Oh, God, yeah.
The ones at PMT.
The ones at PMT?
I used to wear those.
I used to wear those, man.
Hey, Witt's about to kick me off the fucking podcast.
Did I tell the story of how I got the free shoes from Reebok when I was in fifth grade?
No.
Fourth grade.
So our neighbor, John Morgan, unreal guy, he was a big dog at Reebok.
And so he'd get a pair of shoes a day or a pair of shoes a week.
It was insane because at that time, I think size nine, someone at home shaking their head
because there is a size that is like the trial size where in which they make this one size.
I think it was nine and I was a monster in fourth grade.
So every pair of shoes he'd bring to my house,
I'd have to wear right out of respect.
He's giving you free shoes,
Ryan,
you're going to wear those shoes at least once.
And one day he came in or his wife,
uh,
Gwen dropped off a pair of red ones,
bright red Ronald McDonald Reeboks.
And I'm thinking right away,
thanks. Thanks a lot. I'm like, fuck, no, they can't keep this rule going. You don't have to
wear each pair once. You can't do this to me. Well, sure. Shit. Five, six days go by. And my
mom says, hey, you haven't worn the red shoes yet that the Morgans gave you. You got to wear
them tomorrow. I said, mom, please. No. I'm going to get tortured. Please, no.
She says, you're wearing the shoes tomorrow.
So sure as shit, I throw on my khakis, my dockers, and maybe my sweater.
I head to school, and I'm nervous from the minute I'm at the bus stop.
Some kid at the bus stop says something, and he was a nerd.
He was a complete nerd.
I knew I was screwed.
I get to school, and there is, I mean, it's, it's
kindergarten through fifth grade at Cushing elementary in Citroen, Massachusetts.
How many kids in a grade are there? Like 60. So 300 kids I was getting made fun of by 190 of them,
including there was a kindergarten. It was like nice shoes. I was in fourth grade. So I got made
fun of so bad. I went to the office and I fake sick. I said, I threw up,
which I didn't. And I said, I need to go home. What do you know? My mom said, I'm not picking
you up. I know you're not sick. You get the red shoes on and you're getting made fun of deal with
it. And I stood there and I sat there all day while all these people shit on me for my red
shoes. And I'll never forget it. I got home and I threw them in the closet. Y'all never again.
No word of a lie.
That was a journey, man.
That was a journey.
Did you ever get the Reebok pumps?
Oh, I had the pumps.
I had the pumps.
I wore those forever.
This was the sickest hookup.
It was awesome.
But the one time the Reds came and my mom made me wear every pair,
it was not awesome.
Put it that way.
Yeah, Reeboks were huge back in the day.
I don't know why I thought that was so funny, that was i don't think it was it was more like i'm kind of twitching now
remembering that day that probably made me such a miserable prick you sent us that picture you
class clown what grade was that from oh uh that was eighth grade that's another funny story i got
all the funny ones tonight fellas uh eighth Eighth grade graduation, so middle school graduation at Noble and Greeno.
Beautiful prep school, dead of Massachusetts.
I think it's probably where I'd send my kids.
Or fair.
So I'm going to fair.
Eighth grade's ending.
I'm leaving school.
And I was kind of rattled, but it was still, I'd made a lot of good friends.
I was just there one year, and my dad comes up with my mom for middle school grad.
And they give you the yearbooks, and he sees I'm class clown.
I'm like, oh, I got class clown.
Unreal, unreal.
We get in the car.
He explodes on me.
I thought I told this before.
I pay all this money.
You got a class clown?
I got the class clown as my son?
You're the class fucking clown?
And I was like, oh, my God god i thought that was awesome it was just the
worst ride home ever i'll never forget it my father would have taken the suffolk downs if i
wouldn't have so mad i was like oh man and it's funny because my mom found the thing the other
day i sent you the picture and i said you know what being class clown worked out pretty good
didn't it because look at me now I'm just on a podcast talking nonsense.
I think that's pretty clownish if you ask me, Biz.
Oh, you are on fuego.
Since we were on the bad trends, bad haircuts, I used to have a rat tail.
Oh, dude.
There was a kid I bought.
Rat tails are disgusting.
You're one of the kids who cut it off and saved it.
It's probably still in the box at home. Oh, rat tails are disgusting. You're one of the kids who cut it off and saved it.
It's probably still in a box at home.
There were people who saved those rat tails, dude. Hey, I had a front one where my whole head was shaved,
and I just had hair in the front bangs.
Buddy, if I got my elementary school pictures.
Just one little spot?
Buddy, if I got my elementary school pictures... Wait, just one little spot?
Like, basically, probably two to three inches in width
and a half an inch back.
Oh, my God.
Everything else was shaved like it is now?
Everything else was shaved.
Oh.
So your parents never...
I couldn't have gotten that haircut.
Were there no rules for you at the barbershop?
All right, you know what I'm saying? Could you have gotten any haircut. Were there no rules for you at the barbershop?
All right, you know what I'm saying?
Could you have gotten any haircut you wanted with your parents?
I mean, there was nothing really wild.
I mean, my hair didn't do what it wanted to.
I'd go and say, oh, spike it.
But I'd have to put moose and shit in it.
But basically, I'd get a whiffle. I mean, the only thing I couldn't come up with was a mohawk.
That's probably the only thing.
I had a mohawk, obviously, when I was fighting in Wilkes-Barre. I've had
every single haircut known to
man. The only thing I haven't done is
shave the complete top and do
a skullet like R.A.
I got detention in high school.
R.A.s just grew in. They just never
grew in on the top. It's always been the sidesy
backy. I had those stripes
in my head I got detention for in high school, like
that Brian Bosworth used to have back in the day.
But that was about it.
Those came back, too.
I think Kane brought those back.
Yeah, Dana had them back.
R.A.'s grade school pictures, he's got the sidesies back.
Sidesie backie.
Big colic.
I think you boys got into my death wish this week.
Forget about me last week.
You two are off the wall.
I'm having fun.
I'm sorry.
Hey, we're having a blast.
Don't be sorry.
We're having a blast.

because the world's going through crazy stuff.
It's hard to stay motivated, especially when you're working from home.
But thanks to our friends over at Death Wish Coffee,
makers of the world's strongest coffee,
which we can all attest to after last week,
you can stay caffeinated to do whatever you want.
Now, there's no playoffs yet.
We're still waiting.
But once they come back, we won't need that.
We'll be going on pure adrenaline.

And what do you think, boys? Should we send it over to the old AMA, which stands for Ask
Me Anything, by the way, in case you weren't familiar.
All right.
I can hear you backstage. Oh, there you are.
There you are. What's up, buddy?
Well, it's a little odd because
normally it's you coming in first with
hello, everybody.
Not bad. No, not too shabby.
Not too shabby. It'll work, but we can
coach you. We can coach you up.
We're used to having Witt off the hop here.
Of course, Witt being the diva is a little bit late.
Oh, Grinnelli just Houdini'd there.
We were going to put the Chicklets Cup on hold, guys.
We never have really gotten to do this, an AMA.
Normally, they're done on Reddit, right, R.A.?
You thought it was a sex thing, didn't you, Biz?
Admit it.
It does sound very Bond-ish.
Is that the word?
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely, yeah.
There could be an SM quality to it.
I've actually never done one.
I've actually never done one, so I'm pretty excited to do one.
I'm glad we have moderators, though.
What, you're talking about the AMA or the SM?
Hey, I'm down for anything.
A couple more of these.
So this is great.
Like, we never really get to have fans ask us questions.
Witt's going to hop on here very soon.
But, you know, we need you guys just as much as you need us,
if that's even the case.
So this is going to be fun.
We'll snap it around.
Hopefully there's a lot of hockey questions.
And then maybe some really, really random ones for RA,
because that's when things can get real fun.
Yeah, absolutely.
I'm down for anything.
You know my world.
Just no family, no friends like that.
Anything else, fuck yeah.
I'll answer anything.
I like this shit.
Hey, it's funny how we actually wore the same hat.
Well, I actually had my Oakland A's hat on, but it's so fucking hot here.
It's a wool hat.
I was sweating my nuggets off, so I had to switch to the mesh.
Dude, I have  look at  I could grow a mullet right now.
Look at my hair.
Hey, you should do a skullet for
Dude, I could do an L.I. Afraidy right now.
Yeah, okay.
I smoke buskies.
Well, let's start.
Actually, you know what?
Since I already let off with one, and it was like an East Coast League version of a
Hello.
Can we get one from the og sure five four three two one hello everybody welcome to the first ever spitting chiclets ama
with me biz a little bit tidy wit and our boy grinnelly is backstage doing the moderating
hopefully we get a good crowd tonight it's nice to see some people on the comments already they're
not being too many peck heads on there so i'm looking forward to
it yeah guys this is this isn't meant for be anything other than like hockey questions and
having a good time i have a girlfriend now and i'm at a different stage in my life so those old
stories are for the old times i'm trying to get a little bit more mature in my it took me a little
while all right yeah it's all, it took me a while.
35 years to mature up.
Let's get the first question going
here. Where is it?
Oh, it's up on the board. Right there.
I'll read it
because this is a short enough
sentence so I don't mess it up.
Cancel my 830.
How do you think the Leafs are going to do
under the new playoff format?
Oh my God, I almost messed that one up.
I'll let you answer that one, R.A.
How are the Leafs going to do under the new?
I don't think the new playoff format
is going to affect any one team
more or less than the other.
I think it's just going to come out
and it's going to be who wants it more,
especially now more than ever.
No fans there.
If it's an empty rink,
it's just going to be who plays better and who wants it more.
So the Leafs don't have any advantage or disadvantage in this new format.
Really?
I think the complete opposite.
And I actually think there's an advantage for the Leafs.
And this is why I think so. When they come back, normally progressive throughout a season,
the reffing kind of gets, I would say, a little looser and looser.
At the start of the year, a lot of penalties being called
because they want to enforce all the rules.
And as you get to playoff time, it's a little more physical,
a little bit more holding, clutching and grabbing.
With the reboot, I think they're going to call it much like the start of the season.
And I think given the fact that Leafs are kind of like a high-flying
offensive-type team, that they're going to benefit in the fact
that it's not only being called
a lot tighter because more power plays special teams,
but also the fact that earlier in the season,
it's a little bit more like pawn hockey.
You know when you always saw that one guy in training camp
where you're like, oh my God, this guy's going to have 40 this year,
and all of a sudden the physicality comes into play more and more
and they disappear?
I think that for the Leafs, it'll be a nice entryway
and they get some playoff exposure for these young guys.
And who knows, they might even go on a little run.
Yeah, I remember those training camps well, baby, I'll tell you.
All right, next up, I'll read this one.
Would you rather be trapped in a cage with a tiger for 10 minutes
or eat nothing but peanut butter for a year?
Oh, peanut butter. a year oh peanut butter that's like
awful question yeah i mean would you rather risk a fucking hungry tiger mauling you to death but
eat peanut butter nothing but peanut butter for a year okay here actually a spin-off question from
that uh arian foster thought that he could beat up a wolf or he still thinks he can did you remember
the tweet that ended up going viral yeah yeah yeah
i didn't think it was that crazy given its its life or death wolf's not a tiger right
no wolf is a dog no i'm saying is like as far as on the toughness scale
would you put it close not even yeah so i think that it's just like a it'd be like a dog on
steroids a wolf that's not a good comparison basically what a wolf is it's just like a, it'd be like a dog on steroids, a wolf. Is that a good comparison?
That's basically what a wolf is.
It's a dog.
That's a great,
great way to put it.
Yeah.
Maybe a couple of key tokes too,
but you know,
they get that like that,
the wires cross to like a different level,
but I don't think he was off base with that one.
So I kind of spun that terrible question into a,
a even worse one.
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm sure a man has probably killed a wolf before with his bare hands.
Okay, do we have another one?
Oh, all right.
All right, would you rather give up your favorite food or listen to Biz Reed's statements for
24 hours straight?
Who wrote that question?
That was probably R.A. submitted that as his own question.
I don't know this person.
Nicholas Ross, would I rather give up my favorite food or listen to Biz Reed's statements?
You won't offend me, all right.
I know that.
I mean, I can't give up pizza.
I mean, this is not going to happen.
Pizza is my favorite food.
And I love Biz.
I can just bring a bunch of J's with me, and I can listen to Biz go for 24 hours.
But I'd much rather do that than eat pizza.
I mean, I have no more pizza for the next 30 to 50 years.
So I'm going to live.
What would be worse?
Listen to me,
do ad reads or,
or in a room trap,
listen to Cotton Eye Joe.
Where did you come from?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
And you had to dance like the whole time.
Yeah.
Fucking 20,
24 hours straight.
Holy shit.
What else do we got?
Oh,
this is a long one.
I'll let you take this one.
Is this,
this Trevor looks like RA a little bit. Not right now, this is a long one. I'll let you take this one.
Trevor looks like R.A. a little bit.
Not right now with this mop on my head.
All right, Trevor Nettleton. Do you think the current playoff format takes away from the intensity
and passion that is usually seen in playoffs?
Who wants to say they won the cup in 2020,
the year that shouldn't have been?
We'll go to you, Biz.
Well, I disagree.
It's a very unique circumstance so if anything
you know in the future saying oh remember 2020 and everyone's gonna say yes fuck yeah no what
happened then yes uh i we won the stanley cup that year i think as far as the intensity is
concerned my question mark was the fans just add that that much pressure at
least for me anyway and they kind of create that that tension more so so in order to get it to the
level of without the fans in the arena to where it would be with them i don't know i have a hard
time believing it's going to get there and that's not taken away from the players either i just
man like when the fans are all screaming 20 000 of a man your
heart rate just jumps and i was the one on the bench not even alone out on the ice so i uh yes
i think it's going to affect the intensity yeah we talked about on the show i think i raised it
with you biz is like you know there's no one there i think like i said it's going to set the
separate the wheat from the chaff or the chafe from as far as who's competitive and who's less
competitive not that no one's not competitive.
So it's probably a concern as to who wants to say they won the Cup in 2020.
Listen, whoever wins the 2020 Cup or whenever the fuck they play it
is still going to have to win 16 playoff games in the NHL.
It takes away nothing as far as I'm concerned.
We don't talk about the lockout in 95 when the Devils won.
We don't talk about the lockout year in 13 when the Blackhawks won their dynasty.
No one ever says, no, they're asterisk because they only played fucking 48.
No one, no people forgot there were lockouts those years.
No one ever says that.
So they're not going to, especially this year, they played fucking 60 something games.
So not a concern.
Next up.
First of all, Trevor, great question.
And to spin off of that, and we're going to, we're also going to talk about this on the podcast because i'm interested to hear witt's opinion uh strahlman just mentioned the fact about you know
maybe players not necessarily wanting to come back for whatever reason it may be safety at the fact
that they're like oh let's just go from a clean slate next year maybe they're not even interested
in the fact that they can recoup some of that revenue and they just they care more about being with their families so me saying i'm optimistic and wanting it to come back
comes from a place of a fan if majority of those guys were like hey no it's their lives it's it's
their decision and if they don't care about the money it's like i can go find other things to
entertain and entertain me as far as like the hardcore fans are concerned if they voice their
frustration i don't know i've never been in that situation i'm not a jock sniffer like ra me. As far as the hardcore fans are concerned, if they voice their frustration,
I don't know. I've never been in that situation.
I'm not a jock sniffer like R.A.
I'm just kidding.
I'm a wicked jock sniffer. I love it. I love it.
Believe me, I got a lot of shit
when Bettman had the press conference
to confirm everything. I literally finished a blog
20 minutes before that. I wasn't timing it for that.
I said, hey, hockey's not back yet. We've got a long way to go and i devon dubnik raised the same
concerns as strawman did especially for europeans those guys have to come over and miss their
families for you know not everyone's going to bring their family over from europe that's a big
fucking deal so uh yeah of course we want it i mean and it seems like the nhl is intent on having
the playoffs whenever they can and then just rebooting the schedule from there and hey if
that's what it takes so be it all right next right, next up we have PolishCanadian87.
Hey, RA, how did you and Ryan connect to start podcasts?
Who suggested making it bigger and more widespread?
I love this answer.
I'll give you.
Okay.
I met Whit through mutual friends at a bar in town a couple times.
Buddy Brett owned a bar near North Station.
We'd bump into each other.
He was a longtime stool.
He read my stuff. I obviously followed him in the nhl and we weren't like
buddy buddies texting the weather we would bump into each other have a beer shoot the shit very
good casual fun relationship and after he got back from russia he sent out that tweet it was i want
to say december 15th 2015 and he said hey biz i'm thinking of starting one of these podcasts talk
about trending topics and this and that hockey whatever and you said i'm still playing for a couple more years and i slid
i didn't say i replied i says oh a partner ain't kind of half joking but like half serious shoot
your shot buddy fucking right brother within five ten minutes wit slid into my dms he's like you
serious ira i says serious is a heart attack he says do you know how to start a podcast i says
i'll learn.
He says, let's do it.
That was a week before Christmas.
By the Super Bowl, we had our first episode out.
February 16, we were chugging along.
We were like two SoundCloud rappers, Wayne's World, whatever you want to call it, on the couch every week and fucking having fun.
And then, you know, I knew the audio had issues in one episode.
We would go rolling, man.
We were like fucking Abbott and Costello.
Shout out, all the kids off the Google that one.
We were killing each other.
I looked over to hit pause and the fucking thing died.
I was like, oh, no.
He's like, what do you mean?
I goes, dude, it didn't record it because we didn't have a producer on site to say, hey, what happened?
The mixer I had shit the bed.
I said, hey, you know what, dude?
I got an email from this kid from Burlington just last night.
I usually don't save them, but this kid was local, and I did.
That kid's name was Mike Grinelli, another person who shot his shot.
And my mixer literally died the next fucking day.
The next fucking day, the mixer died.
So we're chugging along.
Not long after that, Portnoy.
Hey, Dave, who I  he said, I listen to your podcast,
which you almost shit my pants because he's not a hockey guy.
He goes, it's good.
We want to add you to the roster.
So, boom. Me and Whit, we took off. And here's not a hockey guy. He goes, it's good. We want to add you to the roster. So, boom.
Me and Witt, we took off.
And here's the analogy I use, and I'll end with this.
Me and Witt won a title.
We got to number one on iTunes, all that.
And then we brought Biz along, and Biz made us a dynasty.
That's the way it is.
Oh, ee-haw.
Get the can-eye brands out.
No, really.
I mean, you brought us to the level that we never, me and Whit didn't have that vision.
You did.
And here we are.
Somebody, somebody asked a question online that kind of ties into this.
What brought you into journalism?
Um, a lifetime of curiosity.
I guess I was a newspaper reader since I was like not even five, six years old.
I was just always a curious kid.
And I didn't, it's funny. I didn't go to college to major in it I took intro to journalism I fell
into that and one of my roommates was the co-editor actually both my roommates were co-editors of the
paper and one of them said I'm gonna make you the editor next semester I was like dude I just
took the class he's like I'm telling you and he kind of groomed me for it and I was the editor
of the college paper my sophomore year and then And then I thought I was going to have a journalism career.
And then of course the internet fucking murdered everything when we were in
college and then there were no jobs. And I was just, you know,
trying to get them here, trying to get them there.
I started writing with Barstool in 07 and then the podcast and you know,
it's, it took a long time, man. It was no plan.
There's no master plan to get where I got. I can't tell you do A, B, C, and D.
I just, I just follow my instincts.
And like I said, it took a while to find professional success,
but it's fucking rewarding when it comes.
And it's a good example for anyone who's watching who's still kind of like,
oh, you know, should I do this?
Like how do I become successful at it?
Just dive into it.
Yeah.
Nothing happens if you don't do it.
We try to, you know, you try out the... Oh, hello.
Hello, hello.
Thank you for joining us.
What's up, guys? Oh, did I miss the memo
on the NBD hat?
No, that would have been
awful if you showed up. We would have looked like a team.
I would have immediately
signed off. That would have been the end of the first
AMA that we're doing. Where's Gennady at?
Oh, he just popped in to
say hi. There he is.
What's up, buddy?
Off the top, who's winning in a 100-meter
sprint out of us four?
You, easily. Are you
kidding me? Oh, no. Sorry. The question was
who in the NHL currently?
I don't know, but did you
guys see Waino in the 100-meter
sprint when he went out?
Who did he go against?
Oh, yeah.
He dusted Pele.
Yeah, they were in their 40s when they did that.
It might have been McEnroe.
Okay.
But Ari's still dusting these guys who ran for a living, and he's out on his wheels.
Gretzky shouldn't even have to run if he doesn't want to.
So who was I talking to?
Oh, so I was talking to ray whitney recently and
he was talking about the wizard and he said the one thing about gretzky is he's underrated fast
but what he would do is he would beat you with his first three steps and then he would just skate the
same pace so he would never really burn out he was such an intelligent player that way and i mean it
made a lot of sense i just never had those first three steps either.
Where are the questions?
Who are those going to?
Just on the bottom there.
It's in the purple there on the bottom of the screen.
I see.
So R.A. told his perspective of how the whole podcast started
when you sent out that original tweet.
He said that you guys have been pals for so long
that he just slid right into your DMs and it all happened.
You said we were pals for so long?
Did you just tee me up there, man?
Oh, yeah. I'm gliding sinkers.
I will say, R.A., we met the one time at North Star,
showed up at North Star, no longer around.
And we had a good talk.
I had read your stuff reading barstool but
then i say all the time once i sent the tweet out biz you weren't around and then ra you you
messaged me we let's do it i was just like okay and i look back i think i'm the only person that
would just without even like having a beer or lunch just start a pod with with somebody else so
hey i got a question for you before we get to this really good one how many times when it was the original podcast or even when g jumped on board how many times
did you go to ra's place to record and he slept in that's that's twice ra ra twice second i don't
remember i remember the one time because i just was dead to the world. When was the second time?
I remember hammering on your door
and calling you non-stop.
You're at the point as the caller
where, to me, Biz, tell me
if you know what I'm saying.
You know he's not answering, but you just
want there to be like 700 missed
calls to show how many times.
You know what I mean?
I remember thinking,
I'm like,
I snapped it around in the NHL
for 10 years
and now I'm doing this and this guy
can't even wake up.
What time was it?
11.30. He's like,
this is unacceptable.
He was like a principal yelling at me.
I don't remember the second time.
What happened was, because it's like we had taught...
It's so funny. The second time,
Grinnelly, was when you had your
new Scotty Cameron that you were showing me.
And I'm like, I don't care what the fuck
it's Scotty Cameron right now. Where is
R.A.?
I thought I woke up late one time and we got it.
I'll defer to you two, but I
know the one time I definitely slept through it.
Can we do a documentary?
If we do the podcast for five more years, can we do a documentary at the end?
Sure, but we have to answer fan questions while doing an AMA.
No caller ID.
I get these no caller IDs.
Anytime we do Chicklets Cup, every Friday and Tuesday night, and now we're on this stream,
I'm getting a no caller ID.
If I answer it?
Answer it.
Answer it.
Hello? No one. Answer it. Hello?
No one.
Stop calling me.
And you can't block it.
Okay, this is a great question.
Only when I sign on, I think somebody's doing it and blocking.
Now they just won.
But still.
Let me ask you this question.
Of all the interviews you've done with Spit and Chicklets,
what was the most entertaining and why?
And I'll start off by answering this.
And I think that Tim Stapleton's too easy of an answer.
I'm going to say Sanderson.
To hear firsthand what it was like playing against the Bob Yores
and the generation before I got, I never got to see Bob Yore in his prime.
And, you know, he played with them and he just dove into these stories.
He was elaborating.
He clearly had lived a very similar lifestyle to the way I did at the NHL level,
but even more so.
And he's open to talk about it.
And he's open.
He was calling them at-bats.
That was, I mean, I think immediately you said, hey, I'm going to reuse that.
I'll give you credit, but I'm going to reuse that.
Hey, yoink.
What about you, R.A.?
Tim Stapleton is such the obvious
answer because it was so riotously
funny and it was the funniest episode
we ever did, so we'll say we won't use that
one, but
God, there's so fucking many of them.
Ronnie McClain was very entertaining
because he'd come in that room and
he'd show them. That's a journal answer.
All right, for sure.
Absolutely.
He was the master of teaching us how things work in interviews.
That's what it was.
But just I remember just sitting there watching him and listen to him.
And like he knew what we needed that day.
He knew we would have been working, you know, for a bit that week.
And he came in and he delivered.
And it was very entertaining.
He was very good storyteller.
So I'm going to go with Ron McClain.
I think
that two
things stick out. The first, though, the number
one was when
we went over Keith's house
and Hazy was there.
What happened? I got a no-caller
ID call. It's somebody doing
it on purpose. It must not be a bot.
We just gave him the
gift. It's either Walsh or Foley.
Yeah, Foley.
Sick prank, Foley.
It would more
be the time. I was saying, we went over to
Keith Yandles. Hazy was there
and then Biz was Skyped in.
I thought that was
one of the first times. There had been
others, but it was
Keith, my buddy growing
up hazy and him had become best buddies and all the times in the gym or golf course where i'm
dying laughing i was like that that was what just happened on that podcast i don't know that when
when was that that i think that was when people ask us that that what is the best podcast we've
ever done i think that one might be the best and I think it's because of the answer when we're like,
all right, biggest cock on the Rangers,
one, two, three, go.
And they answered it.
We don't need to go into too much detail.
There might be some kids listening.
I think we should probably give a special nomination,
a special nod to Biz here,
because before we brought him on the show,
he was our biggest hit,
which is pretty much why we brought him on to the show.
That was when I was telling the crazy stories.
I'm telling the cornerback a little bit.
You'll grow up, Biff.
It's good.
Hey, the other thing was the whole West Coast wagon tour because the Yandel Hayes one was hilarious.
We were still at Keats House.
Then all of a sudden we're on the road with Purcell and Bugsy.
And then it was being at the all-star game with like great
access I think that's when I was like oh boy this is uh this is taking off um somebody asked about
my former coach Mike's your foreskin no no my former coach it's just right here at the bottom
it says if you just read um it's asked about my former coach Mike Stothers want to call their
couple of them we're
actually going to save that for the podcast but it was unfortunate to see him let go six years he
spent with the king's organization um we'd spent uh time in manchester together then moved to
ontario which i mean segwaying out of the stutter stuff and we'll save it for the podcast is that
new western division in the american hockey league oh it's it's the podcast, is that new Western division in the American Hockey League.
It's the best living in maybe the NHL.
Yeah, you purposely get sent down.
Palm Springs is getting injected into that division as well as Henderson,
which is the town right outside of Vegas.
What do they got, the Silver Foxes or something?
Silver Knights.
Okay, Silver Knights, my bad. And then, of course, they got the the silver foxes or something silver knights oh okay silver knights
my bad so and then they of course they got san diego in that division uh and then and biz they
get mad fans there too san diego i think it's 10 000 a game yeah they're nuts so then they're at
that old coliseum too i thought i don't think i fought gratton actually in that building or maybe
i did once but either way like they they still like that old school style of play,
and you get to live in San Diego.
You mean McGratton or Josh Gratton?
No, McGratton.
McGratton played for the San Diego Gulls.
Oh, yeah, that was in Ice Guardians.
Yeah, yeah.
I was asked actually to be in Ice Guardians,
so I guess we rambled on a little bit.
You said no to something?
What's that?
You said no to something?
We're paying him.
It's a documentary.
No.
Here we go.
I told you guys a story about Dean Lombardi.
When I called Stutzi in Feuds, I said, listen, I'm in a bad spot.
I said, I need a place to play.
And they called Dean Lombardiardi and he gave it the okay.
And he goes, just tell him to stay the fuck off Twitter.
So I really, really toned down all the social media.
And then also that season, I think we only lost 11 regular season games.
We were on this heater.
And given the fact that I reached out to him because I didn't have a team to play on
and they'd given me the opportunity, I didn't want to come in and be a distraction.
I ended up being in the documentary because I fought Gallant twice.
And this is a funny side story.
So Gallant, who was playing in Bridgeport, we fought right away at the start of the game
because he also had the camera crew following him around.
So I wanted to give him one.
And I got the better of the first scrap.
And then he asked me again.
And I thought it's because he wanted a better showing. Then I found
out that that was his third time doing
two scraps in a game and he was getting
a game suspension.
He didn't have to play in the back-to-back.
On the Sunday when we played our second game, he got
to go fishing.
That guy got out of the game and I had
to eat a couple of his punches.
Did he get you better
in the second one?
Him and his brother are tough customers. His brother was playing in game and I had to eat a couple of his punches. Did he get you better in the second one? Oh, yeah.
Him and his brother are tough customers. His brother was playing
in San Jose with the Barracuda.
They weren't getting any fans. There was like 200 people
there. Dude, I'll tell you, Henderson is going to
crush it because it's only 20 minutes away from
Vegas. In Vegas, it's expensive
because it's a strip. They're just
strip prices, but the tickets are going to
start at 10. They're going to be sold out all the time. It's going to be huge. Then having to have your AHL thing down the street, that's because it's a strip. They're just strip prices. But the tickets are going to start at 10. They're going to be sold out all the time.
It's going to be huge.
And then to have your AHL thing down the street, that's huge for an organization.
And Foley took a shot.
He's like, we're not going to have an orphaned stepchild here or something like that.
Basically, it was a dig at all the other franchises.
Well, you can't.
Shots fired?
Shots fired.
You can't.
All right.
What are you crushing?
He's on his, like, temp here. Little blinding kugels here. All right. What are you crushing? He's on his like 10th year already.
Little line in Kugel's, yeah.
All right.
So we might see some RA action here.
Oh, wait, wait.
About that, Biz.
Hell of a move staying off Twitter.
I mean, I knew you needed the contract, but it was like that's mature of you.
Did you ever write out tweets and just like almost like send them or you just save them?
Or were you just off the internet?
I'm going to be honest.
It was nice to get away for a little bit because it was intense.
Speaking of Twitter, what do you guys think about Max Kellerman's statement on Twitter?
I'll let R.A. start because he loves going at this stuff.
You know what, Biz?
A bunch of people tagged me and I just said, don't take the bait.
It's ESPN troll shit.
I respect guys. They work.
Stephen A. Smith, that's what they do. They say stupid shit to get people to watch the show, to pass the stuff
around. I don't want to be part of that. That's why
when Chief wrote the blog,
don't be triggered by Max Kellerman's statement.
I'm like, well, you just wrote a blog, so you
got triggered by it, but I love what you
did. Say, hey, I'll take you to a game. Make it wiggle
for you. I'll buy you drinks. I thought the way
you handled it was great, but me, I'm like, whatever. I have my issues with ESPN and the NHL, I'll take you to a game. Make it wiggle for you. I'll buy you drinks. And I thought the way you handled it was great.
But me, I'm like, whatever.
I have my issues with ESPN and the NHL.
I wasn't going to go there.
My one thing about sports, I wasn't necessarily the biggest soccer fan.
Of course, the diving deterred me a little bit.
And it's a little low scoring.
But when you go to an experience, when I went and played over in Cardiff
in the EIHL when I was basically Sidney Crosby over over there thank you very much uh i went to a cardiff uh a cardiff city game and they they
ended up winning the the like the second league down and they got is it relegated does that mean
getting bumped up no relegated means you go down okay well they went the other way i know english
isn't my first language and but it was cool i got to go experience a game when they were on top,
and the fans were into it, and they're chanting the whole time,
and it's experience.
So then after that, watching soccer, especially when you're getting to
the Premier League and the Champions League, there's 100,000 people,
and you kind of remember the chanting, and you can only imagine
how much more intense it is.
So getting a live experience will make you a fan of most sports
if you go and enjoy and experience the way it should be.
Yeah, but I'm more on R.A.'s side.
I don't think he even cares.
It's like a little jab he can throw.
It's getting his name all over the Internet or whatever,
all over the hockey Internet that we see.
That's a sweet crew lately. But I think that if you look and you actually see Kellerman ever say anything
smart about anything, but boxing,
it's a miracle or someone's telling them because they have, they have like,
he's a perfect boxing guy, analyst, whatever.
And then they throw him on ESPN and he just has to pretend like he knows about
every sport.
Like I could never go on there because I wouldn't know enough about the other
sports.
He'll just throw out wild clown claims and know that people get rattled by it.
And look what happened.
Although I don't know,
I guess writing the blog means chiefs rattled,
but I guess he was more trying to give the message you just gave to a large
audience.
I was,
I was breaking his balls.
Like obviously because the blog was actually very well written. love chief we know that and by the way it's called
promotion and relegation if you go down you get relegated you go up it's getting promoted
promoter okay thank you all right um who wants to read the next one i think wit should what's
the story behind rick from red deer did that happen organically or was that planned? It's my favorite bit you guys do.
Funny enough, Crowley's
kitten.
I think this guy might be trolling
because I've gotten a lot of give up
the Rick from Red Deer schtick.
People get sick of it.
We don't do schticks.
I've heard from a couple people, schticks.
I'm talking about a fan that has to plug his car in at night
because it's freezing up there, just getting rattled.
So I would say that it happened by us, what, talking about the Battle of Alberta?
Battle of Alberta.
And then I think we were talking, we were saying something incorrect.
We had no clue what we were talking about, which kind of happens quite often.
And then we imagined this guy from Red Deer in my head.
He popped into my head with the
i always thought him as a flames fan people say he's an oilers fan but just
listening and wanting hockey talk and breaking down the x's and o's and instead he's got us
just talking about like the bachelor or something on tv or ra's favorite simpson episode
and there he was born so i don't think it's a shtick one bit no you pulled it off the top of
your head you just like rick from red deer we all started dying laughing and that was it man red deer has die
hard hockey fans biz you know that oh yeah what else we got we got another one
that was crowley's kitten by the way who asked about rick from red deer crowley's kitten
little shout out who's the who's the girl? Oh, Carol Baskin.
Oh, yeah.
She got the prison.
Not the prison.
Well, the prison for the zoo animals.
She got the zoo.
She got Joe Exotic Zoo in like a lawsuit or something.
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, and then the sheriff's come out and said that her dead husband's name was forged on the document that got her all that property.
Stop starting rumors, R.A.
What moment did you fall in love with the game of hockey?
You want to go first, one of you guys?
Go ahead, Whit.
I wouldn't remember the exact moment.
Loser.
Anything in my memory is just I was obsessed with hockey
from the first time I remember anything.
Does that make sense?
Yeah. I don't remember anything before kindergarten.
And even then, I remember some things.
My memory is bizarre.
I can remember every single golf shot someone hits, but I can't remember what I was told
to get at the store when I'm sent down by my wife.
So I don't know when I fell in love with hockey.
I just was always obsessed with it.
So you're the loser, Biz.
I know.
I know.
First, I would say I originally fell in love with hockey.
And keep in mind, my mom used to bring me to skate when I was like
I mean, the videos, I must have been two.
I was just walking on the ice.
I didn't even have the chair, but you had the double blades.
And when I started playing house league, I got bumped up really quick because I was naturally good.
The only time I was ever somewhat decent at my level.
So I remember them bumping me up and that kind of that positive reinforcement, like I felt that I was really good at something, just kind of initially made me fall in love with it.
And, you know, I stuck with it. And, you know, I stuck with it.
And, you know, there was a few bumps along the road.
But it was, I mean, it was probably right from that house league mark around the age of like five or six.
And from then on, I mean, I really fell in love with it when I got that Wayne Gretzky aluminum stick underneath my couch for Christmas the one year.
The silver one?
I think I got the gold one.
But maybe it was silver. I have the photo on my phone, but we were all done opening our presents,
and I was happy, and my dad was like, what's that under the couch?
And my mom was like, yeah, I think I see something.
Same thing.
And I went under there, and right away you grab it, and you're like,
oh, my God, there's no way, and it's unwrapping, and and then you unwrap it and they caught the moment probably on i don't know what camera
they had at the time they don't got them like these days they caught the moment when i kind
of looked at it look back at them and boom snap and that picture's been you've you've had that
picture on the internet right yeah it's an unreal one yeah and that was like the og that was like
the first time there was ever a two-piece stick like that. And that's when it ramped up even higher.
It's probably one of those old VCR things that basically you're like a newsman
out there putting your shoulder and shit.
I mean, I say I fell in love with hockey in utero,
like when I was in my mother's stomach because legit,
my mother and father had season tickets for the 71-72 season.
And, well, I was conceived in August that of 71 so
from that whole season I basically gestated in my mother as they went to every single Bruins game
during the 71-72 season they actually won the cup down in Madison Square Garden that year but the
three games they played in Boston my mother was at all those games nine plus months pregnant with
me so I was fully formed in the garden had these fucking games because I couldn't skate for shit.
I acknowledge that. So when I come out, it was just always Bruins, man.
I don't ever remember not having the Bruins in my life, like being a little kid watching them on TV.
It was just born into it. I mean, literally like from the from the womb, born into being Bruins fans of Bruins family, always watching them.
So I say I fell in love
as an embryo.
That's a great answer, R.A.
She had the game call. She had the
headphones on her tummy
so you could listen in.
She was gasping beers and ripping fucking heaters back then.
Oh, come on.
If you could live
in any U.S. city other than
the one you're currently in.
Ooh.
Wait.
If you could  I'm pretending like I can't see it because I messed up the sentence.
If you could live in any U.S. city other than your current one, where you're living and why?
Where are you living and why?
It means where are you living.
Is that poor sentence structure or bad reading?
No, it's a little bit of both.
Okay, thanks.
You should have been able to figure that one out.
But what's yours, Ari?
I don't know yet.
Shit, this is one of those if 20 years ago it would be a different answer.
But if I had to pack up and move right now, I'd want to be near the water
because when you grow up in Boston, you need to be near the water.
I know you guys would probably laugh, but probably Sarasota.
Like, that's a good spot in Florida.
Laugh? I mean, it was Panama Beach or Sarasota.
It works out perfect.
Probably Sarasota.
I mean, it's a good happening place.
It's kind of quiet.
Tampa's right there.
It's a good spot.
If not that, maybe Nashville.
Nashville's a fucking awesome city.
Yes, Nashville's sick.
Biz, what about you? Anywhere in the world, I'd probably live in Victoria, maybe Nashville. Nashville is a fucking awesome city. Yes, Nashville is sick. Biz, what about you?
Anywhere in the world, I'd probably live in Victoria, British Columbia.
U.S.
All has to be in U.S.
Then it would probably be Denver as opposed to  listen.
Denver is a mile high.
Scottsdale is unbelievable and was ranked, I think,
number one city to be in while quarantined,
just given everything, the weather, nine months of the year it's perfect it is cooking right now but
i think denver just given you know you got the the mountains where you can go hiking oh did we
lose ra was my answer that bad did he leave us i'd say denver i think that's a good answer no wit
ra just remembered that he brought home a huge thing of edibles from Denver one time.
He's like, oh, I knew I left those in the closet.
He just ripped away to get them.
Yeah, it's like how to get through hip blood security.
Spent two years and he couldn't remember until he heard the word Denver.
Well, that and all the drugs that I ingest are easy to get in Colorado.
So that's why I want to go there.
Yeah.
So, I mean, I love Jupiter, Florida, but I wouldn't want to be there all summer.
I'd have to be able to go somewhere in the summer.
It's too hot.
So year-round, any other U.S. city, this is tough.
Chicago or San Diego.
The winter is brutal.
Dude, I was going to say, San Diego has got to be the answer.
I've never been there.
I'm not someone that needs  I mean, I like to golf,
but I don't mind some bad months, a couple, especially if you can get away.
Do you like to grind?
I love it. I love it there.
All right, what's the next one?
Scott's mail's up there.
That might be a call.
Craziest coaches Biz and wits have ever had i mean crazy i don't want to say crazy but but stothers was it was intense and and that's why i love them
the accountability i think that that's transferred over and into my everyday life where you know
you know being a grown-up you have to be more and more and more accountable. And I think that that's why sports are so important.
I'm going to put my kids in a sport just so they can, you know,
not only learn the accountability but, you know, the teamwork
and the camaraderie.
So I'd say Stutters was the most intense.
Like he  the funny thing about Stutsy is we were in junior,
and we'd be watching video, and he'd have the laser pointer out,
and he'd stop it, and he'd be in front of the whole room.
So it was a no-holds-bar roast fest every time we were doing video,
which was comical.
Most guys would be in their jerseys like this until it was their turn,
and then they'd be like, oh, poor me.
I turned it over and got yelled at.
I feel like when you're younger, the coaches are crazier.
I wonder if that's still the same.
I think it's probably starting to switch.
But Parker at BU, Jack Parker, legendary coach.
He had a temper.
He would snap sometimes.
I remember he'd hallway treat me because you could drag the guys off the bench at Walter
Brown Arena and down the runway
to the locker room. He'd just drag me down
there. He's screaming in my face.
I remember that.
Times were different back then.
It was great.
It made you play better,
I thought. Now, if you did it all the time,
it was ridiculous, but it wasn't like that. It was only
very occasionally. One time time he was so mad.
We were up at Cornell getting smoked and they had like a rivalry from, from back, like in
the seventies, Cornell and BU and they're pounding us.
Their team was sick and he comes in, he's screaming at us.
I'd never seen anything like it.
And his face started getting like red purple and
he was a little older at the time and the the trainer larry went over he's like jack jack it
was like the older you get you start realizing like you can't continue to get as mad as you're
getting so he definitely chilled out a little bit after that his later years they won a national
title but he was nuts once in a while but a legend right, I guess you can't answer that one.
I'm picking my basketball coach in high school, my baseball coach.
Biz, you're probably the closest I've had to a coach in the last 30 years.
I would say more than anybody.
And I know I mean that in a good way.
Actually, quick, funny story.
I suck at baseball.
He's the craziest coach.
My team was so desperate for players.
My principal was like, Brian, you want to play baseball?
I'm like, Mr. Cale, I'm terrible.
He's like, I don't have a glove.
He's like, I'll get you a glove.
I was like, oh, they really need players.
So I played baseball.
I wasn't a starter.
I was off the bench.
And it was like one day I got on base.
I think I walked, and no one gave me a signal.
No one told me nothing.
I just said, fuck it.
I'm going to steal a base.
So I somehow miraculously stole second.
Then the inning ended, and the coach was like, what did you do that for? I was like, fuck it, I'm going to steal a base. So I somehow miraculously stole second.
Then the inning ended, and the coach was like, he was an old guy.
He's like, what did you do that for?
I was like, I don't know.
I just felt like he took me out of the game,
and that was the fucking last time I played baseball.
Oh, no.
One lifetime stolen days.
Watch out, Ricky Anderson.
I think the coach was right.
I think the coach was right in that situation.
Oh, absolutely.
Thank you.
Fuck.
I'm kidding.
What do we got here?
What school would Biz pick if you could go back and go to college route?
Arizona State.
What program would Witt play for if he went major junior?
Do you want to answer it first?
London Knights get paid absolute cake.
You can't say that anymore.
You can't say that. We're not talking about the London Knights. paid absolute cake. You can't say that anymore. You can't say that.
We're not talking about the London Knights.
Fair enough.
You don't make those jokes.
What if City and your team just pounds everyone else in the OHL?
Oh, man.
Arizona State has a team now.
Well, I know, but they didn't back then.
I'd have to go back.
I think the first team
and really the only team because i was going major junior the whole time i knew i was going top two
rounds come on this is a major junior guy can you tell oh hl guy here oh hl guy i think i think
notre dame was was something that i would i would have considered i don't even think i got any
official letters but i think that they came up at some point.
And, you know, that's a pretty good school.
I mean, if I wasn't going to make pro to have that type of education,
it would be awesome.
But, yeah, if it was now ASU for sure.
And once they get their new arena here, it's going to be awesome.
What's the closest, Tom, Quebec Major Junior,
yeah, QMJHL team to Montreal?
Is it Laval or is it one in?
I think there's a couple around there.
That's where I'd want to play.
Really?
You're a Montreal guy.
Love Montreal.
Well, Quebec City would be a cool place to play.
I've heard that's an awesome city, but it's Quebec.
I've heard nothing but awesome shit about it.
Yeah, I played the Pee Wee tournament there in 1997.
It was the world championship
we won. South Shore Kings
83 team. Okay, somebody start
reading the questions because I can't read anymore.
How long does
this thing go?
Probably another 5-10 minutes
if we can get some good questions.
This one is from
obliam97.
This is a tough one.
We love everybody in the league,
but if you had to move any team to a new location slash city,
what team would you move in?
Where would you move them?
I don't mind this question.
I mean, immediately you've got a fan base
that's going to despise you once they see me say it,
but you go.
I'd move the Blues to Kansas City.
No, I'm playing.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, all right.
That's a troll job.
I'm joking.
Fuck, man.
I mean, I know Florida's the obvious guess because they don't draw,
but they're trying so hard to do the right thing out there.
But it's just the arena situation sucks.
I don't know. Quebec deserves a team. I know that's
the most probably obvious, logical thing to say,
but if I were to
have to do that, what was best for the NHL?
Yeah, I would probably move the Panthers to
Quebec.
Your hands are going to hate your guts.
I don't know. You can go to the Montreal
and party.
It's actually harder than I thought.
Very difficult question on the spot.
Yeah, I think probably the Canes.
I mean, they're getting better.
No, they're getting way better.
It's not even close.
Take it back.
No, because when they aren't good, if they aren't good again,
there's just nobody there.
So, I mean, you've got to be really good every year to be there.
I'm not choosing.
I'm not like, hey, the Canes need to move.
But if you're going to ask me the question, they'd be the team.
I don't know where, though.
So that's what makes it difficult.
That's why it proves that I actually don't mind the Canes being in Raleigh.
So, Biz, don't try to put words in my mouth that cause a stir.
I'll stay on as long as you want.
Don't try to fuck with me.
I just buried you on that.
I was Max Kellerman there.
Maxie.
However, I'll play the Stephen Smith part.
I love Stephen.
I think that guy is classic.
He's great, man.
He's branding himself.
He's an entertainer.
Absolutely.
I'm having a hard time answering the question,
and I could imagine some of the messages that are coming up right now.
I'm sure that the  Oh, oh coming I'm sure that you guys are so predictable
but maybe just a Scottsdale biz
won't even consider
moving in the gonads
I would
I'm going to skip this question
I can't think of anything interesting.
Pussy.
I'll come back to it.
I'll come back to it.
I'm dressed like one, all right?
That's comfy, though.
That pink Whitney tie-dye.
All right, Matthew M.
We'll go to Biz first.
Which favorite piece of memorabilia you kept from your hockey career?
True.
That's a decently long list.
Three-game point streak, Pucks, Arizona Coyotes.
Got me a little plaque because I went on a three-game heater.
No big deal.
And it was actually on the Canadian road trip.
It was that one where I had two assists in Edmonton, I believe.
And I had one in Edmonton, Vancouver, and Calgary.
So Rick from Red Deer was punching the steering wheel that morning.
I have the game sheet for my first ever NHL game.
And like Crosby and Malkin's on it, Alfredson.
And it was the one that was played in the world premier game.
So that's pretty cool.
I have a gold medal from the under 18 world championships
to go along with the team. The Team Canada got us a ring as well.
And probably my, what do you call it, my Calder Cup ring as well.
So it's hard to really put one into that category.
Just a reminder to everyone from Biz what he's done.
I mean, he's going to build a nice room for all his hardware at his new house
because you have a lot of medals and rings.
I didn't realize that.
Well, I mean, did you win any championships?
World Juniors?
I won the Quebec Peewee World Championship.
That's the last time you won anything?
Yeah. Wow. Well, let's think about it won the eastern conference does that count that's a trophy yeah that's the um
they gave me a mini one and i lost it because i don't want that i got second place for a golf
tournament my partner legend mike riley my buddy buddy, he saw me just throw it away.
He's like, dude, what are you doing?
I don't keep second place piece of shit trophy.
So, yeah, I don't have much.
I have the silver medal, which actually it feels like you win the bronze and the gold and, you know, you lose the silver.
But still looking back, it's an Olympic medal.
I get that hanging up somewhere.
And I have a Lidstrom stick, sandpaper finish, signed.
I obviously didn't play, but when I did sneak into the Red Wings locker room
that night, I'm going to confess, I did grab a roll of tape
and take it for a souvenir that night just because I knew it would never happen again.
So guilty Pittsburgh police, I stole tape.
McCarty's jockstrap
sniffs it before a big podcast remember we had the the what did you have signed by pedro martinez oh the paper from an altoids can the paper from an out hey he he took a ziploc bag and like and
like drenched mccarty's jockstrap sweat and kept it it It's still on a Ziploc where he found the edibles from Denver earlier.
Dude, there's nothing sicker than going through, what do you call it, TSA,
and then cleaning your fucking clothes out and finding weed in your bag
that you put right through the metal detector.
I don't know about that one.
They don't care about that, do they?
They don't.
That's when I realized they don't.
Have you ever had to shit during a game, Whit?
Have you ever left the bench?
No.
Nope.
There's a funny story, and you can find it on the Arizona Coyotes.
Oh, oh, oh.
Their team website.
We did a pillow talk with Ray Whitney, and when he was playing in Carolina,
he'd been eating, is it cabbage soup or cabbage
rolls he'd been eating a lot of cabbage rolls and he had his stomach was rumbling while they were
listening to the anthem and he thought he had a fart and he let it out and he just completely
shit his pants but he but the thing is in the NHL when you're on the on the list you can't sub anyone
out you have to start the game and if you start somebody who was not on the game sheet as a starter,
they get kicked out of the game.
So he had to take the opening shift with shit in his drawers.
And then, of course, after he just went right down the tunnel
and missed half of the first period.
The thoughts have lumps.
I believe that Daniel Paille shit his pants on a breakaway in the NHL
when he was playing with the Bruins.
Literally or, like, figuratively?
He got a lot of breakaways.
No, I think he pooped his pants.
It might have been in the NHL.
Maybe it was in minor hockey, and I'm getting the stories mixed up,
but we used to call him Horse, and he's from Welland, Ontario,
and we all had the same coaches and stuff.
So I've heard that story before.
He's just such an awesome guy, isn't he, Pye?
Incredible guy, incredible guy.
They were huge, that fourth line that year when they won it.
Now R.A. is going to just drool.
Hold on, I need a minute.
Yeah, get the Kleenex out.
What was the  oh, I told the story on the podcast.
I never did it in the course of a game
or had to leave um but when i was doing my paper route when i was younger is it was a little bit
of waste for my my place because somebody had had the route by my place and i wanted to do paper
route and make some money so i would have to like drive my bike like a couple miles to start my
route and on the way i'm just you know putting away and then all of a sudden i lean over take a fart and shit my drawers i finished the route played through it
and for whatever reason when i got home i took off my underwear and i put them at the bottom
of the hamper and i never forget that night my mom like called me over and she's like that is a
savage she's like what are you what what are you doing here, bud? Are you on drugs?
I panicked, boys.
I panicked.
I panicked.
Biz, how about the paper with the big paper on Saturday?
It sucked.
Wow, yeah.
Would you have one for the weekend?
Listen, I did something stupid.
No, Patriot Ledger was Saturday.
Oh, my bad.
I was thinking the Globe or the Herald.
Sorry.
And you never used to get paid to deliver the flyers either.
That's what sucked. You had to load the flyers either. That's what sucks.
You had to load the flyers and it took like 30 minutes, but I'd roll it later.
That's where I got that long stride, just the paper route.
I'll say this.
The paper route initially taught me how to manage money.
And once you earned it, and you remember you had to get up in the morning.
I delivered at, I believe, 6 a.m.
So I'd be getting up at 5.45.
So when you would go collect and you would earn your money, it taught you the value of a dollar.
I mean, I had a job at a young age.
I believe I was 10 years old.
You'd be thankful you're not a degenerate gambler then.
By the way, you mentioned Ray Whitney a couple times tonight.
The Wizard is such an awesome guy.
I was very fortunate to meet him on our travels earlier this season a couple of times,
and he is a fucking awesome dude he's such a great guy if we were ever able to get him on the podcast
he his father was the trainer and he was the stick boy for when the oilers were in their dynasty
he's played everywhere he's played with so many different guys that have he knows every he knows
everyone he knows everyone he's also uh a smaller guy who made it in a very big man's game early on.
And I was talking to him the other night,
and he was talking about Theo Fleury,
and people don't understand that Theo Fleury paved the way for small guys.
And he did so by clawing for every inch.
And I don't think Theo necessarily gets the respect he deserves.
Is Theo in the Hall of Fame?
No. He should be, though.
Yes.
That's weird.
I think this is the last one. I think
G said, what is the loudest
barn you guys have played in?
Back in 72 on that time.
Go ahead, Whitney.
R.A. played street hockey in an actual barn
in Vermont when he goes on
vacation we won uh the loudest i can start off yeah so um okay well chicago was going to be one
of my two answers chicago and playoffs when we beat them in six the one year with the coyotes
how are you uh the one game i played one second got
kicked out after fighting bowling but coming out of the tunnel when they were playing stranglehold
and the lights were off and remember the united center was built for mj so i still believe other
than maybe montreal it's it's one of the highest seating arenas in the nhl and just coming out to
stranglehold and that's when they were still in the NHL. And just coming out to Stranglehold,
and that's when they were still in the midst of their dynasty,
and it was the hottest ticket in town.
It was just something else.
And even when I was a healthy scratch,
which was a lot of the time when we would play in Chicago,
I would quickly get all my gear off, get in my gitch,
and I would run around to where the Zamboni entrance,
and I would always listen to the anthem there and how intense it was.
run around to where the Zamboni entrance,
and I would always listen to the anthem there and how intense it was.
And my second answer would be Vegas.
Of course, they had that tragedy in Vegas, and the first ever game was against the Coyotes,
and I was doing the broadcast.
I couldn't hear myself think,
and they established themselves as one of the loudest arenas.
I still, now I don't go travel on the road,
but I dreaded going in there because the whole time you just,
you can't focus on the broadcast because it's too loud.
It's crazy.
The Golden Knights have established themselves as one of the craziest fan bases.
NHL, Montreal is right there too, the way the seats are.
But the loudest one was the arena in Halifax for the World Juniors,
04, I think, maybe 03.
When Tutu was breathing down your neck?
Ask any up-shuttles on Canada.
We've talked to a bunch of guys in that game.
And it was  you could not hear yourself.
Like you said, you couldn't hear the coaches.
You couldn't hear each other like on the ice trying to talk at moments.
It was so cool.
And they just, I mean, you imagine being Canada and just having that like behind you.
It was just, they were on a train.
And Russia won.
I actually have one more answer.
Although I feel like they've been dethroned of this.
The first year Winnipeg was
reintroduced into the NHL,
where'd they come from? Atlanta? Yeah.
I was,
I think I was playing with
the Coyotes at the time, and I would say that
the first couple experiences there, those fans,
and I know the arena's not very big,
but that was one of the crazier ones. They've gotten
a little bit, I don't want to say corporate,
but a little bit of jam has came off.
So that pretty much wraps it up.
Actually, you know what?
I'm going to give a non-NHL game category
because I've been in the pro-money playoff Bruins games.
I don't know what the fucking decibels were,
but one of the loudest fucking crowds I ever heard in that building,
you know Dennis Larry Witt, how he did that skating game charity years ago,
and Michael J. Fox came on the ice,
and he had recently been diagnosed with the Zildjian Parkinson's.
And he was still at some mobility, but he wasn't 100.
And he came on the ice in full gear.
And honestly, it might have been the loudest fucking crowd I ever heard
inside the Fleet Center TD Garden, whatever it was called.
When was that?
Fuck, man.
It was probably 18, 19 years ago.
It was a long time ago.
And I remember just like the place just fucking exploded because of the situation.
And everyone loves Michael J. Fox, of course.
But the Boston Garden was I saw the Bruins beat the Canadians in game seven at home.
I don't know what year it was.
Maybe it wasn't game seven.
And the place was insane.
it wasn't game seven and the place was insane that that reminded me of uh a story ra is uh when gordon downey and the tragically hip were doing that tour across canada um i got a text asking
me if i wanted to go to the concert he was doing back-to-back shows in vancouver and i was like
well of course yeah and that was probably the the if we're talking about live experiences that was
probably one of the most
probably the coolest live experience of my life and how touching it was he came back for two
encores and it was it was just the energy in the building was like nothing i'd ever experienced in
my entire life and rest in peace to gore downey tragically hip is uh that's canada to me that's
canadian royalty yeah it's weird, man.
I wasn't even familiar with them.
For some reason, they just never latched on down here as much as they did up there.
But yeah, I'm familiar with that story.
But I think that was the last question, boys.
I just got a message from G.
I think we're going to wrap it up.
Big thanks to everybody who did send in a question
for that AMA back about a week and a half ago on Twitch.
Much appreciated.
We'll be doing it again.
We had a lot of fun doing it. Also want to mention, hey, most guys have tried
different ways to last longer. But thinking about baseball and playoff stats doesn't always cut it.
That's why the folks at Roman, an online men's health company, are changing the game with Roman
Swipes. Roman Swipes are a clinically proven way to last longer in bed. They're effective,
easy to use, and fast acting. And the best part, they don't require a prescription.
Roman can ship swipes to you in discreet, unmarked packaging,
and each swipe's packet is small enough to hide in your wallet for whenever you need it.
Swipes are great.
They will not transfer to your partner, so you can last longer without worrying.
They're super easy to use.
Just take the swipes out of the packet, swipe it on, let it dry, and you're good to go.
That's it.
So go to Getroman.com
slash chicklets, and you can get your first month of swipes with just 5 when you choose a monthly
plan. Spit it out. That's getroman.com slash chicklets. And now we're going to send it over
to Pittsburgh Penguin, Patrick Mallow. Well, our next guest is currently in his 22nd NHL season.
Between regular season and playoffs, he's played in over 1,900 NHL games. He's a member of both the 500-goal club and the 600-assist club.
He's the San Jose Shocks all-time leader in games played, goals, and points.
He's also played in three NHL All-Star games.
And somehow he's only missed, by my count, just 31 regular season games in those 22 seasons, which is incredible.
He's currently a member of the Pittsburgh Penguins,
and it's a pleasure to welcome to the Spittin' Chicklets podcast,
Patrick Marlowe.
Thanks for having me.
What an intro, R.A.
Holy shit, good job.
Good job.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Pretty easy, though, when you do what this guy's done.
Just puts it up on the ladies' tees for you.
Yeah, I had to cut a few things, believe it or not.
Well, I was going to say you're probably leading in the clubhouse, too,
for playing that long.
How many times have you heard guys on the ice say,
let the kids play?
A few times, yeah.
So, where do we begin?
No, I was actually going to ask you first about,
because of what we're doing, everyone knows about your kids
because they've been so involved when you became close
with Austin Matthews and Mitch Marner.
So are they just running you ragged right now,
street hockey, playing outside?
What's the deal?
Yeah, all of that.
Especially my youngest, my five-year-old,
the first thing he does is ask me to go play something,
whether it's shoot balls on me to go play something whether it's uh shoot shoot
balls on them or go shoot play hockey outside or golf or get in a hot tub or swimming or it's
non-stop but it's great uh you know it's i have to keep reminding myself you know you're not not
probably going to get this opportunity to spend this much time with your family ever again.
At the same time, you're trying to take advantage of it,
but I'm not sure you guys know it can get a little long.
What's his best sport?
Are we looking at a potential scholarship here, save you some money?
Because you need the help.
Maybe.
I don't know.
They like hockey. I'm trying to push them into baseball so I don't have to bundle up as much
and watch them in a hockey rink.
So I'm trying to put some sunscreen on instead of a parka.
I'm told that nothing beats when the kids are like little league,
11, 12, watching them play baseball.
But I think the first few years is a battle when the four-hour games start,
when pitching begins.
Yeah, they let the kids pitch for a little bit,
and then if they can't  if they walk a couple batters
and the coach comes out and starts throwing them in.
Yeah, you wake the coach.
Sometimes it's better to keep the kid in there.
Yeah, you just wake the coach up quick, and he goes and makes the switch.
Patty, so do all the teammates keep in touch on like a text thread
on a daily basis?
How's the communication work with all the boys?
Yeah, there's always something going on.
It seems like we all  obviously, we're pretty involved with the union
and the PA, and there's always a few questions, what's going on.
And I think everybody's asking a question, what's going to happen,
what we're looking forward to especially
right now it's probably the hardest thing
and knowing
how to get ready
for whatever's coming next or when the season
is going to start again I think everybody's
trying to figure out when that date's going to be
Is there a pretty high level of frustration
or are guys coping a little better
or is it kind of very guy to guy
Yeah I'd say very guy to guy i think probably a lot like me sometimes you wake up it's like okay
groundhog my wife laughs at me i get out of bed every day like groundhog day let's go
but some days are better than others that's for sure i was just gonna actually go back to the
beginning that's kind of what we do here especially uh with the guy who's played as long as you but played junior played in the whl
and then of course you're the second overall pick the year joe thornton's number one overall right
no so going into that season was there was there a kind of a a race to be had or was it he he was
already sitting number one like you remember um those years
especially your draft year the nerves and then basically your thought process throughout that
season uh yeah no i think it was just you know being i was in the west and he was uh in the o
so obviously there's there's that oh hl bias for business but there's that i think uh i was just
trying to put myself in a good position
in order to get the draft. You never know.
Or I didn't know at that time, like how, well,
how things would turn out or even the night before the draft, I was,
I met with San Jose,
met with Dean Lombardi and came and met all his scouting staff.
And then he walked me to the elevator and he shook my hand. He goes, well,
if we keep the pick, we're going to take you. If not trade it away so like okay great so I had no idea if they were gonna keep the
pick and take me or I think it was and Joe was already pretty much a done deal I kind of heard
they were working on a contract and that was that was a done deal so yeah I didn't know where I was
gonna end up so you've played so long
uh because of your wheels and how good of a skater you are was that from the get-go like right you
know seven eight years old you were always the fastest player or was it actually over time where
you became you know one of the best skaters in in the world uh well i don't i don't know how hard
it was to be the best skater in the farm community where I grew up.
Oh, really, really small place where you lived when you were younger?
Yeah, really small.
Yeah, like there was maybe 100 people in town.
It was a farming community.
So we'd have to  What were your rides to play hockey?
Sorry?
How long were the rides to get to arenas to even play at?
Not  like growing up wasn't too bad i think it's gotten uh as soon as i started playing in swift current when i was like 12 13
then everything practice was like uh you have to drive for an hour to get to swift current from
from the farm uh so we do that three times a week basically go in uh two practices and then
on weekends we go go for games to get on the bus go somewhere or just go to swift current so um yeah now but now like even though small towns there's not enough
kids to make like we would aneroid was where i grew up and vanguard was maybe seven eight miles
away and we would combine kids to make one team and that kind of happened all around like the
farming southern saskatchewan to do that.
Kids have to  kids pool together, but they still have to go, like,
an hour to do that.
So, yeah, the farming community is dwindling a little bit
as far as kids' wise, so.
Yeah, so you mentioned Swift Current.
Did you go watch any Broncos games?
And if so, who were the guys you looked up to?
Who were the superstars of the Western League? And who would you go watch any Broncos games? And if so, who were the guys you looked up to? Who were the superstars of the Western League?
And who would you go and go over?
Yeah, it was a great time to be growing up when watching the Broncos.
They won the Moral Cup, I think it was 89.
So they had players like Sackick, Sheldon Kennedy, Jeff Sanderson.
And the funny thing is, like, that's all I knew.
So that's all I want.
I just wanted to play for the Swickron Broncos growing up
until I actually found out what the NHL was about and everything like that.
So Tyler Wright.
They had so many guys that went on to play NHL, but it was
one of my favorites was a smaller defenseman, Danny Lambert.
I think he played for the Nordiques for a little bit. I think he scored, like, two of the quickest goals. He dumped  he was a smaller defenseman, Danny Lambert. I think he played for the Nordiques for a little bit.
I think he scored like two of the quickest goals.
He was a D-man, too, and he dumped the second goal.
It was off like a stanchion and went in, but it was like one of the quicker goals.
Yeah, they beat the Saskatoon Blades in the Memorial Cup Finals,
so it was pretty fun to be a fan then.
So, Pat, you're a rookie.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Was that the first year of entry-level deals?
For my year?
That's a great question.
It might have been pretty  I think it was.
It was definitely near the start of it.
After the Dagle?
Yeah, I was going to say Dagle cost you a shitload of money.
Dagle got paid, though.
Yeah, you can rip him if you want.
It's kind of that kind of podcast if you want to lay into him.
My memory of him is just the one ad he had when he was dressed up as all the different, like a fireman, a cop, a nurse,
and all this other stuff.
That was pretty big back then.
What did you know about San Jose before you got there?
Anything?
Nothing, really.
I didn't know what to expect.
I didn't know if it was going to be like a desert or sand or palm tree
or beach.
Or there's no girls, and they call it Man-O-Zay.
So you brought your own, right?
Yeah.
I think I must have found the diamond in the rough because my wife's from
around this area.
Oh, okay.
So I'll just go.
I'm going to jump off the Zoom call.
I'm going to jump off this Zoom call right here.
All right, see you guys.
Patty, great meeting you.
That's biz for you.
There you go.
There you go.
I can't wait to hear the comments
on fucking social media.
Yeah, that's,
that's league,
league known,
man Jose.
So,
everybody's working in tech here.
So, I mean,
they're just,
just grinding it out.
They're working.
Bookworms.
They're bookworms.
It's a male-dominated industry.
So I got a question, right?
Like San Jose, the first few years as a team, they were just so bad.
I remember Mark Reckie told me it was like if you didn't get three points,
you'd be furious that night.
And you got there, and you never really experienced it.
You made the playoffs every single year, rookie year and on.
So was the fan base already as crazy and passionate then, or did it take you a couple years of made the playoffs every single year rookie year and on so was the fan base already as
crazy and passionate then or did it take you a couple years of making the playoffs even though
their first round losses is that what grew it to become like you know one of the best home crown
advantages in the league now I think yeah I think it definitely grew uh throughout the years that
I mean you know hockey fans as soon as you're a hockey fan, they're all in it.
But definitely going and making playoffs,
that's a whole new experience for fans, right? If they haven't been in the playoffs, they don't know the excitement,
the way things ramp up.
Guy, there's so many places to go with San Jose.
I mean, you just mentioned the early parts
and how you guys got pretty good right away.
A big component of that, and I don't know how many years you were in at the time,
but getting Joe Thornton and how shocked you must have been.
And then, like, not to carve your old teammates, but you're like,
we got him for what?
You know, that is pretty remarkable.
Then all of a sudden you guys get to another level.
Yeah, definitely.
That was huge for San Jose, uh huge for it was huge for me
personally having him come here um just to see the way he approached the game the way he kept pushing
uh to get better and to just keep going each and every night um that helped me uh you know
evolve my game and obviously eventually i got to play on his wing. I was playing center for a while there right when he got here.
But, yeah, being able to play on his wing,
it was so much fun going into the game just knowing, like,
I'm going to get two or three glorious looks at scoring tonight,
just being on his line.
Guaranteed.
Yeah.
So I just  my job was just to be ready and put in the back of the net.
And, yeah, it was a lot of fun.
I got to ask you a quick one here before R.A. asks a big one.
Is there many a times where the coach and him would get in a little bit,
hey, you got to shoot this, and he's like, nope, I'm a passer?
Did that actually happen in the video meetings?
Yeah, it happened.
I think he would just shrug it off like, okay,
these guys don't know me by now, and they don't know me.
That's unreal.
Sorry, Ari.
That's all right.
No problem.
Patrick, I think you turned 18 in your first training camp, right?
Is that correct?
Yeah, yeah.
So, I mean, 18 years old, first time in the locker room,
like all kinds of veterans.
Who, if anyone, like kind of took you under their ropes?
I mean, there weren't too many young guys on that squad.
No, there wasn't. But I had a great group to come into.
I think like Gary Suter, Tony Granato, Kelly Rudy,
Mike Vernon, Doug Bodger, Billy Holder,
like all Bernie Nichols,
I just...
Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing
when you said those three names?
Bernie Nichols, what a...
Got a couple stories that are coming to mind?
Want to open the vault?
Yeah, I mean,
these guys were great
to me right away from the start, I think.
Little things like, you know, rookies, you get off the bus,
you're going into the hotel room, and you're getting your keys,
you're about to get in the elevator, and, you know,
the rookies hang back, the rooms go, and I'm pretty sure I never had to wait.
They'd always say, hey, get in here, get in here, come with us.
Same thing for dinners, like, get in here, we're going for dinner.
I don't think I paid for a dinner.
You know, if I did, maybe one or one or two throughout well the rookie dinner for sure but uh yeah they took care of me everybody took care of me it was such a such a great group marty mcsorley uh dodie
wood um sean burr yeah these i mean you've played with some legends of the game these guys are
characters that's for sure yeah there was there was no shortage of good times.
Can you remember your rookie party?
And do you remember, like, did you have to, like, get up there and tell jokes?
Or is it so long ago you can't even remember where it was?
I actually lucked out.
I think we were in Florida, but I think we didn't get, like,
a nice expensive restaurant. We went to
Joe's Crab Shack
or something like that. Guys were just trying
to get the bill higher and higher.
But I think
I only paid
1,500, 1,600.
Oh my goodness. What?
Rich get richer.
This was like 1984.
So I mean,
you've got to think of inflation what do you got what do you got all right patty you were on the team when uh owen nolan
refused to take the ceremonial face off uh with queen elizabeth were were you not
no i don't remember that i don't remember at that at all. I thought it was 2002. Yeah, for our listeners, basically, it was a ceremony.
Was that in Vancouver?
It was in Vancouver, yes.
I vaguely remember that, yeah.
So what happened?
Well, Queen Elizabeth, she was in town,
so they were doing the ceremonial puck drop.
And Owen, of course, born in Belfast, Belfast, Irish, up the wazoo,
and all the political stuff that had been going on.
He refused to take part in it, which is unusual.
But, of course, if you know the history there, it wasn't an unreasonable stance.
So I'm just curious if you remembered it or if it was a big deal in the locker room at all.
Now that you say that, I do kind of remember that.
And I probably wasn't the smartest kid back then, knowing the history and all that.
So I think it's, I've gotten to know a little bit more over the years,
but yeah, that does make a lot of sense that he wouldn't go take it.
Owen Nolan, he's from near my hometown.
I think he's from Thorold and grumpy guy, right?
He's a bit of a grumpster.
Depending on the day, yeah.
I think I had a lot that had to do with Daryl being our coach too.
So he was, you know, he wanted you to come to the rink, you know,
pissed off, ready to play.
And I think, you know, a lot of guys kind of took that to heart.
But, yeah, no, Owen's  he's still here.
So I see him at
the rink all the time he's coaching kids and um i don't know if he'll end up coaching my kid but
you never know but uh he's doing he's doing a lot of good things around here and i think he's
probably gotten uh he's a lot better now uh he's always he was always pretty good to me so i can't
say a bad thing about him and and he pointed at dominic dominic hashish knows and said i'm about to
snipe one bar down on you and did it in san jose one of the best all-star moments of all time
um actually before i move on because i'm kind of jumping around biz i want to talk about we he was
we were mentioning old veterans and i said bernie nichols right so i looked at his hockey dv you
know one year he had 70 and 80 150 150 points Bernie Nichols did one season.
Oh, my goodness.
In the NHL?
I had no idea.
I had no idea he had a year that big.
Oh, my goodness.
I think he's one of five who have scored 70-plus goals,
and I think he's usually  it's a good trivia question.
That's a great trivia question.
Well, does he let you know?
Does he tell you?
No, no.
He's pretty good.
Always loved playing cards in the back of the bus, on the plane.
I got a pretty good story about him.
I'm like, I'm 18 years old.
You know, it's a really veteran team.
And show up for a morning skate.
And he goes, hey, kid, come with me.
We'll get a rub.
Get it.
So all he wanted to do that morning was stay off and get a rub from the  and I hear Bernie Nichols tell me what to do.
All right, I'll hang out.
So I went and did his thing, got a rub.
I think I ended up getting scratched that night because I didn't go out
for a morning skate.
That's one of the
He just wanted somebody else.
I'm going regular season games?
Yeah.
That was one of your regular season games at UMass because of Bernie Nichols?
Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Hey, that's like the story we had Ryan Reeves on,
and one of the veterans had told him in one of his first few years in camp,
hey, go in the hot tub.
It's great you loosen up.
And he fell asleep or something like that.
And Keith Kachok just buried him.
But typical older guy, he knows he's burying you,
but he's going to take you for the ride.
So I want to talk Olympics, right?
Because you won the gold medal in 2010, suck on that wit, 2014 in Russia.
But I was kind of surprised.
In the 2016 that they sent over,
I think it was Torino.
You didn't,
you had,
you having a huge year and you didn't,
you didn't make that team.
Was that surprising?
Like heartbreaking?
Were you,
were you kind of looking to make that club before the season had even
started?
Yeah,
I think,
you know,
always every time there was Olympic season,
I wanted to,
you know,
give myself the best shot possible to make it.
And yeah, for whatever reason, didn't make it that year.
And by the sounds of it, I kind of might have been okay because, you know, I don't remember what they placed.
They did not do well.
They didn't do well.
But, yeah, no, I was always interested in being on those teams and wanted
to be on those teams. What was your initial take on Brent Burns when you first met him?
Uh I did I really didn't know what to what to expect but I had he came in with the huge beard
like like he has now probably things would have been different but uh yeah he was great I think
uh coming in right away and just a great personality
i think he's got his hands and everything he knows that he knows a little bit of everything and
uh when he gets into something he just dives into it and finds out everything he can about it
well i was gonna ask if mike ricci was the was the handsomest teammate you've ever had.
Yeah, just ask him, yeah.
Sexiest man in San Jose, I've been told.
I thought it was he got voted Denver's sexiest man, wasn't it?
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.
He'd let us know about that every time he went to Colorado.
What did he do? Like in the middle of the room, like right the game everyone's getting changed he's like boy
it's just a reminder come on oh yeah yeah so he was a funny guy yeah he's a funny guy he likes to
have a good time and uh yeah he gets a crack he gets a kick out of that he he loves it patty
taking a look at your stats after the lockout in 05,
I'm going to specify because there's been a few of them,
you posted career high in goals, assists, points.
Was there some you did different in your approach to have your total go up
almost 30 points?
So is the time off beneficial in some way?
Jeez, how many years ago was that?
I don't know.
I think things were going good, I think, right before the lockout too.
And then for whatever reason, having a year off maybe helped.
I don't know.
But just being hungry to come back.
That year that we lost obviously would have been great to play that year.
And even, you know, you never know what could happen
when you miss a season or throughout a season.
So it would have been nice to be able to play that year.
We were interviewing Crosby, and he was talking about how each summer
it gets harder and harder to, like, get your body prepared for the season
in order to keep up with the game  the speed of the game right now because it just keeps getting faster and faster
and younger and younger how hard have you found it in these last years because you know that
thankfully because of the way you skated your entire career you were able to play so long
but clearly you know you're getting to a certain age where it must be very difficult to get to where you need to play.
Yeah, I think so.
I mean, it can be.
I enjoy working out.
I enjoy doing all those things still.
So I think that bodes well for me.
But one thing I have changed is I usually take a lot more time off the ice. But just to stay in it, and I know guys are doing it all throughout the league where they they
they don't take much time off the ice they uh they they are skating throughout the summer so i've
i've kind of started doing that more and i think uh you know it kind of helps i kind of like it
i like uh switching things up so just to keep it fresh and um so that's one thing but going with the skills coaches too like last summer uh austin has a
skill had a dale belfry come to arizona to do some skills work with some uh some guys flew in for it
so i went and went and did it for a while and um you know he's got me trying to do these things on
the ice i'm falling down on my ass like left and right and uh but it's challenging so it's
it's uh you know trying trying to learn
new tricks new things and who knows if i'm using it on the ice or not but uh it's nice to nice at
least uh put the work in and try and learn something new you can't yeah you know you can't
lose your skating legs if you just never stop skating you continue to skate every week for the
whole year you'll feel good all the time. Yeah, there you go.
Were you on the  no, you were definitely on the team
when JR came on and told us the most insane prank of all time.
Do you remember that?
I remember I wasn't there when that happened,
but I remember the story when they came back
and something you'll never forget.
The way those guys tell it, you can just picture it. uh i think it was was it tory mitchell or yeah i think it was david's head
of gucci yeah tory mitchell one of them was running like through wayne newton's pasture
with the horses and i could just see him flying by the horses just trucking they said he was still
shaking at the rink the next morning. I could imagine, yeah.
That was quite the story.
JR was a wild man, eh?
What was it like playing with him?
Yeah, he was kind of going back to like his age and my age
are kind of comparable now.
So you kind of see what, you know,
the things that he was going through when he came here,
looking for a cup and and all that
so he he uh definitely brought a different element to our club at that time and uh obviously always
like to have fun and and do uh you know some crazy things and he had lots of stories but uh
uh yeah it was good to good to have him there and guys wanted to win for him so that you know kind
of helped our our club uh you know come together he also had his 500th goal there i think it was a dump and like hit a stanchion biz or something
it hit a stanchion behind like literally behind the net and popped out off the goalie it was
pretty crazy he still had a class he had a celebration like he just went end to end it was
perfect hey patty i know you went through some captain drama in San Jose.
Do you think sometimes the C or the A matters more to people outside of the
locker room than inside the locker room?
Yeah, I think so.
After going through all that stuff, you know, at the time,
you don't like the way things kind of, you know, having it and not having it.
You know, it can take you back. Yeah, you look embarrassed having it, not having it, you know, it's, it can take a lot, take, take you back.
Yeah. You look embarrassed about it.
Yeah. A little bit. Yeah. I think, and then you kind of, you know,
it's what people think on the outside, you know,
they don't know what's what's going on on the inside and why it's actually
done or, you know, and things like that. And it, you know,
sometimes if that's brought to light and shared,
then it's not as bad, but people are going to have their own opinions anyway.
So having gone through that, you learn to control what you can control
and kind of move on.
That's kind of what I did.
And, you know, I think I use it as some fuel to, you know,
just focus on my game and what I can do.
On a happier note, and I would like to start the episode with the answer is your wife tweeted out something about players having
goal songs and I would imagine that you guys had the conversation together and you would have picked
one one I didn't even hear the answer if you have what would was your pick for your goal song uh what did the what did
we come up with uh i think it was like dust on the ball or something like that so i don't know
everything gets sweet everything gets sweeter with time i think that's the one of the lines so
all right all right being an older statesman i thought it would be good but who knows there's
always gonna be there you go again everybody's's going to have an opinion, right?
And I had a sillier follow-up question.
If you could pick one game in your career where you'd go back and replay it,
which game would it have been?
Oh, wow.
It would have to be a playoff game.
You can tell me it was a great question to stall.
It is.
Stall tactic.
You can pat me on the back through the Zoom, actually.
Yeah, geez.
Yeah, it would have to be one of the elimination games that we lost
in the Western Conference Finals, either against Vancouver or Chicago.
Yeah, or even Dallas in the second round.
We went to like three or four overtimes.
Well, talking about those games, who do we have on who's talking about?
I think it might have been Biexa when he talked about how he just
the team didn't feel confident going into game seven.
And, R.A., didn't you say you mentioned you were in the hallway or something
and you could just sense like the Boston room was a lot looser going into those games you just described did you did
you sense like you guys were going to win or were you guys very nervous in that locker room
uh no I think we were we were pretty confident in our group I think uh at that point I think
you know we'd go through the regular season.
We had really good, like, really good teams.
So we were always pretty confident that, you know, things were
that we were going to win.
And obviously, it's a game of inches at that point in playoffs.
And BX's goal was off a stanchion.
Nobody knew where the puck was and came back to him.
And he was the only one who knew it and shot from the blue line, I think,
on the ice and went in. All right. I got another guy i need to ask you about and that is uh
jonathan chichu because a couple of those years just some of the best hockey you've ever seen he
was a wild man out there with sick release what do you remember about him and joe's connection
and just seeing him get 50 like that making the game look so easy. Yeah, it was completely amazing.
I think he got them from the slot each and every time.
I think probably him and Brett Hall and a few other guys
who had made their living in that slot, that soft area,
made everybody collapse now.
Now there's no room in the middle of the ice.
But, yeah, Jumbo and him had quite the connection.
And, yeah, that shot he had, it was like,
it was by the goalie's ears each and every time,
just perfect, perfect shots, perfect passes
from both those guys was great.
And then you got to see Eatley too.
Oh, Heater.
I mean, you've seen a couple guys come in
and get the score a few goals.
Yeah, when Heater came in, actually, that's when I was able to play wing
on the other side.
So Heater was playing right wing, Jumbo was middle, and I was left.
So that was our line in 2010 in the Olympics.
So it was pretty  and Danny Boyle made the team as well.
So it was kind of funny.
Babs was like  I think  who was it?
Either Dowdy or Weber was on our power play unit.
So you guys  he'd send us  you guys just do what you do because we were
he had  our coach at the time was Todd McClellan,
so everything was kind of similar teachings. and Todd had just came from Detroit.
So, uh, you know, we'd be calling, calling our breakouts and, and, uh, the way we set,
set things up.
We'll go back to Babs, but I want to ask you about one of your comments, um, about the
middle of the ice closing down like that slot area.
Where, where have you seen the game gone?
Like where do you need to score from now in order to be successful?
Like right in front, you got to get those, you know, rebounds, this and that.
But I think also like the goal scorers, obviously like Matthews and Pasternak,
they're finding areas that are away from the slot,
like way back door or, you know,
just different areas that guys aren't covering right now.
And they're finding, they're getting the puck.
They're playing with good players that can get them the puck
and see the ice really well.
So it's definitely gone from right in the middle to backside,
out of that home plate,
and those guys are good at it.
I want to ask about Babcock because I believe that going back to the Twitter thing,
I think your wife sent out a tweet on behalf of you.
You commented on the fact that you didn't think that he would prevent anyone
to reach a certain milestone in games and essentially defending him.
How was your relationship with him?
And, like, obviously there was some pretty, you know,
gnarly stuff that came out afterward that I'm not down with.
How did that all play out?
Yeah, a lot of that came out, and I kind of heard, like,
talking to Mitch when I first got there, heard things that came out.
But Babs, he was
pretty good to me, I think,
when I came in.
It was definitely when I came in that Toronto was about
supporting the younger
guys, the core guys that they got there.
Yeah, that was kind of his big focus
at that time
for me.
Were you bumped out? You weren't able to finish the duration of your three-year deal there?
Yeah, I think, you know, things obviously didn't go as well in the playoffs there.
I mean, it was great.
The teams there were great.
All the friendships, and obviously you guys see it.
Those are going to be lifelong friends for me.
You can't put a price or anything on that.
So that was huge for me.
That was fun.
And it's given me a whole new perspective of what guys have gone through,
moving with their families or just moving on their own,
all the things you have to learn, all the different routines.
So I think it's made me a better teammate, a better leader,
and it's definitely helped me out.
Why do you think you, Austin, and Mitch hit it off, the three is so good?
You guys are like the three musketeers instantaneously.
It's kind of rare to see, given, you know, the age difference in the league.
Yeah, I don't know.
Those guys are just great guys, fun to hang out with.
They like, you know, you got Mitch, who's just,
I don't think he's ever had a bad day and you know
probably here there he has but uh he he just loves hockey loves having fun uh you know he's dancing
before games and but uh they're all business once once they step on the ice and that's what i i love
about that is that they uh you know they can people say you can't flip a switch this and that
but i think you know those guys can have have fun but
yet once once you hit the ice it games on there you know they're going to do their best out there
they're going to play their butts off and um yeah just just fun to be around i think part of me too
selfishly i wanted to to see what they're all about these guys are highly skilled players
young group young guys how did you know how did they get so good so fast and uh selfishly i'm trying to steal
shit from them but uh after keeping the league a little longer boys yeah yeah yeah after trying
to steal some of the stuff i realized i can't do what they do so i'm just gonna stick with what i
know how to do i thought you had them around because you didn't want to pay for babysitters
you forced them to babysit all the time so you and your wife could get some alone.
Maybe, but it's almost like I have to keep a tabs on them
so they don't teach my kids too many bad things.
It was always great having those guys come over.
That was probably another thing too.
Sure, I met them at the rink and and then uh you know they're good good
guys to me this and that but i think maybe what maybe took it to another level is once we had
them over for for dinner how they got along with their kids and how they you know just uh took a
liking to them and played with them and they weren't they weren't like god get away from me
you know go then all of a sudden they're not wearing your jersey anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah, I thought you were my fan around here.
Yeah.
So I'm a skate guy.
I wore terrible same skates my whole career.
And you have  I've always been told there was an issue, right?
You wore these Reebok skates forever.
No matter what new skate came into the in like into the game you were holding on
to these rebox what year did that begin and what was the whole scenario like when you actually had
to switch when you ran out of pairs so i can't remember what year they came to mikey aldrich
our trainer here and said hey uh we we only have so many uh parts left for Patrick's skates.
And he's like, okay, make as many as you can and ship them all to me.
And at that time, Mikey would know better than me.
There's probably maybe like 15 pair.
So I used to go through probably like four pair a year,
four or five pair a year.
So at that point, I started cutting it back to like two pair a year.
And then like the last
the last couple years in toronto there i was like like one and a half like just trying to
right kind of yeah yeah but then i think i you know doing that i think i screwed myself in the
end because i i finally got in this last year last summer i'd always try and get into new skates but
i finally got into new skates this year and i like them i love them now so it's it's funny how much once you think uh they're they uh
they're they're ccm so they you know they're gonna do i get you yeah they did a good job just uh
replicating what i had and i think they were like those things were like everybody would grab my
skates i'm like how do you skate with these things?
They're like way five, five pounds each. I'm like, Oh, I don't, I don't know.
I just, you just get used to them,
but I probably screwed myself by just sticking with the same pair.
I should have just kept, you know, they always come out with new models.
So you would try,
you would try the new ones and then just something about them. Right.
Like you're like, I just, they just don't feel, but, but you're,
what you're saying is true.
I bet you if you just didn't have yours anymore and you had to,
if you had no option, it would have been way easier.
Yeah, for sure, for sure.
But, yeah, they'd be like, you'd go out there,
sure, you'd be, you'd play with them in the summer,
be playing summer hockey.
Oh, yeah, they're not bad.
But once that training camp started and you're in the corner
trying to do a tight turn, you're trying to beat somebody,
it's like, shit, I can't do it it so then you just go back to what feels natural well it's funny that
we're on that topic because i find a lot of the the snipers in the league now and guys who are
able to sustain that are constantly switching into the new model because i think there was a
situation this year and i hope he's not upset that I told the story. Kessel was having a hard time shooting the puck
because his sticks that he'd used for so long,
I think they stopped making them.
And then he ran out.
So the jump from how they used to be to, like, let's say,
eight years down the road,
there's such a difference in the way they all snap now.
And if you don't keep adapting, you're going to eventually find a rut.
Yeah, there's so many guys around the league like that.
I remember talking about Chichu.
Chichu had these sticks, and obviously everybody knew how great they were
because he was scoring a ton of goals.
But towards one of his last years in San Jose, they stopped making them.
And he didn't like it.
He was always complaining.
There you go.
Yeah. Fucks with their heads. Pardon my French.
I hope your kids aren't listening.
They might be.
They learn a lot of those words
through driving around with their
mothers.
I thought they were going to Bugsy's day school
online or something.
We just had Ryan Malone on.
He was in Vail with us.
Oh, there you go.
Patty, I mentioned in the intro,
I think you've only missed 31 games in your 22 seasons.
What do you attribute your longevity and durability the most to?
Boy, I don't know, just luck maybe.
Luck and then working with the great trainers,
I think training staff um mike patenza
strength coach here has been great and having you gotta have a you gotta have a support team i mean
chiropractors massage therapists uh i got another guy here he's uh uh toby hansen he has his own
it's like torture he like digs his fingers into all these points on your body.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's a kid show.
There's a lot of young listeners on this.
Just be careful.
He's excited.
Yeah, it's
I won't just cut you off there.
Save yourself the headache.
I know how media can go these days.
I mean, you played in Toronto.
You know if they catch wind, you're talking about this kind of stuff
on our pod, man.
They're going to have a field day with you.
For sure they will.
Yeah.
What do you got, Whit?
You got one for them?
Man, like how long do you want to play, man?
It's like you just love the game, huh?
I do.
I love it, and I still have a passion for it.
Obviously, I'm trying to find that ring.
And I still have a passion for it.
Obviously, I'm trying to find that ring.
So that's still pushing me to play and trying to win that championship and be outstanding to be able to, you know, hoist that Stanley Cup
and get that ring.
But I still have fun doing it.
I still love it.
I still love the competing out there.
doing it. I still love it.
I still love the competing out there.
We'll see how long
the wife and kids
will let me. Right now,
the kids are older, so they want me
to keep going.
That helps a lot.
You're going to get to
1,999
regular season games
and that pregame skate is going to screw you out of 2,000 games played
for a regular season.
That's going to happen.
Bernie Nichols.
Bernie fucking Nichols.
Hey, Pat, you played in Seattle for two years for juniors.
They're getting, obviously, well, ideally they'll be starting the season
after next.
How do you think the fans are going to take to the team up there?
Is that a city that's been hungry for a franchise?
I think so.
I think over the years, like the minor hockey, the Snow Kings,
I think they're called, or at least that's what they were called back then,
has been growing huge.
And it's right close to Canada too.
So I think Vancouver, the border there, I think they'll do well.
I think they're primed for a hockey team there.
I got another one for you.
You've been in pretty close to wine country for the better part of 20-something years now.
Have you become an anaphile in the meantime, or were you already a wine drinker?
Coming in, 18 years old, with all these older guys on the team,
there was a lot of wine being drank at dinners.
And so they were ordering all this wine, Silver Oak, Farniente, Camas.
So I got a pretty good education my first few years in the league
and now been able to go up there and get on some wine lists and have a little collection of my
own.
So I wouldn't say I know a lot about it,
but I do enjoy drinking it.
What'd you go to?
Cake bread.
I think right now I got the yellow tail,
the box stuff.
We use that joke 60 times on this podcast already.
It's one of our favorite jokes.
You just beat the wheels off that yellowtail joke.
Well, the baby duck in the box, I think that's what we had growing up.
Man, we've taken a lot of your time.
Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Did you think we were going to ask you about?
No, I came in with an open mind.
I had no idea what I was in for.
What did you think?
Did you open up more than usual with our show or no?
I don't know.
You tell me.
I'm supposedly not a talker.
Have I been talking pretty well?
Yeah, you've been great.
Absolutely.
You've been crushing it.
Yeah.
You've been great.
We didn't know if you, like, hated the media folks.
So we were like, I don't know, come in one-word answers.
Like, screw these losers.
Just a quiet guy, Biz.
He's just like you.
I'm just not a fan when the media turns one thing into something completely opposite.
Which they can do with anything.
Yeah.
So you're fucked after coming on here. Oh, you're
toast, man. You're hating on the media. Post it,
Grinnell. Twitter right now.
Marlowe calls out Toronto media.
Only the people who do that.
There's not a lot out there,
right? So there's a few out there that'll do that,
but not a lot. Okay, I have to ask
you this, actually. This one just popped to my mind.
What do you make of the whole
Brian Burke-O'Connell situation?
Have you heard about that one?
No.
Regarding the Joe Thornton train?
Oh, yeah, I did vaguely, yeah.
I read that.
How about Burke-y challenging O'Connell to Donnybrook?
The second GM.
You love that.
You're old school.
Come on.
Yeah, that's  no, haven't seen that come out you
that would have changed you know everything or like changed so much for for me personally having
if uh joe didn't come here you know it would have been who knows what would happen that would have
cost you a lot of money it would have cost me a lot of money a lot of gold, yeah. So thanks to O'Connell. You should be Team O'Connell then.
That's a secret made up.
Was the team quietly hoping some night Joe actually did score four goals?
I think so, yeah.
I think like a couple years ago he had three,
and everybody I think was just feeding him the puck left and right,
trying to get him that fourth one.
You know he's a man of his word, too.
Oh, I'm just thinking of random stuff right now.
Was it true that you used to get completely undressed between periods
and jump in the cold tub?
Yeah, between the second and third, I do that.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Do you dunk or just the legs?
Just depends how hot I am.
I'll get up, get into, like, up to the nipples.
But, yeah, the guy who'd dunk all the time was Heatley.
Heatley would come in in the morning.
He'd have a huge, like, rock star energy drink.
He'd sit in the hot tub for a little bit and you'd be drinking that
and then you'd get out jump in the cold tub and do a complete one or two dunks and you get out and
go ready for practice oh man that was worth the rock star soundbite man talking and you talking
about nipples post that one too grinnell that'll get the people buzzing we'll get an extra hundred thousand clicks because of that uh what else uh i was gonna say because
you're such normally a quiet guy what seems like that uh like probably in the locker room um who
were some of the funnier guys that that were louder in the locker room that you like loved
like you thought oh my god this guy's pure comedy every day oh well there's probably too many to list but uh
what i'm thinking off right now is uh that i really enjoyed being around was uh tory mitchell
uh demers in phoenix is good oh yeah he's he's a character yeah when i first came in the league
i'd say marty mcsorley and Dodie Wood,
they would go after each other all day long.
And it was comedy to watch the one-liners.
Sean Burr was in there too with them.
But there's always, you know, a couple of guys that are just comedy to be around
and you love being around.
What type of banter between McSorley and I forgot the other name you said.
What type of stuff?
Give me a typical morning conversation
between these two idiots.
Dodie would
go, hey Marty, do you want some
tape? Some sock tape,
white tape, rack of lamb.
It's like the same one- liners over and over loving it
what one of the teammates i want to mention uh mark andrew mark edward vlasic was he did you
think one of the most under unheralded defensemen of say the last 10 years in the league
yeah he could be obviously uh you know playing that defensive style for most of his career.
I mean, he can score the goals here and there and do some offensive work,
but obviously playing against the other team's top lines night in and night out
and being here in San Jose has probably gone under the radar for quite some time.
But obviously the hockey guys, the hockey gurus,
or people who picked all the Team Canada and teams like that,
they always have them on the squad.
So it goes to show you that, you know, it is appreciated.
They know how good he is.
I got a silly question.
Was it weird skating out of a shark head for the first time?
Were you like, this is kind of stupid? I've always wanted to do that. Or were you like, this is awesome, I'm coming out of a shark head for the first time? Were you like, this is kind of stupid?
I've always wanted to do that.
Or were you like, this is awesome.
I'm coming out of a shark head.
Yeah, I think it was that one.
It was awesome coming out of it.
I think at that point, I don't think anybody else was doing it.
Now you look around the league, you know,
everybody's kind of got some take on it.
And I think it's pretty cool.
And that Metallica song is just bumping.
What's the name of that song?
Biz.
No clue.
Don't have the slightest clue. Do you know Marlo?
No chance.
Fuel? No, it's not his country song for his goal song.
Yeah, that was a brutal answer.
Country, dude? What's wrong with you?
Are you a big country guy? Well, yeah,
you're from Sask, right?
I never used it. I never got to play it before i left so i have to if uh
i'll have to come up with something new i think did you uh did you uh meet those guys the metallica guys yeah they come into the locker room every now and then so it was pretty good his uh uh
the kid was playing with the junior sharks so it was pretty good. His kid was playing with the Junior Sharks, so it was pretty cool to meet him.
Oh, awesome.
Yeah, they're a San Fran-based band, aren't they, from the neck of the woods?
Yeah, they come to quite a few games.
Neil Young comes to the games, too.
It was pretty cool to see him.
Paddy's like, yeah, I actually had them play my kid's fifth birthday.
It was a little aggressive, but, hey, you know, we did it for free.
Things started to get broken when they started playing, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, Pat, we can't thank you enough for joining us.
I know you guys are bored out of your mind right now,
so we appreciate a bunch of you coming on and having a chat with us.
And hopefully we'll see you on the ice soon, brother.
We're really hoping for that.
All right.
I really enjoyed this.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks, Pat. Our pleasure for that? All right. I really enjoyed this. Thanks for having me. Thanks, man.
Our pleasure.
Good luck, buddy.
Huge thanks to Patrick Milo for joining us a couple weeks ago.
Great talking to him.
Dude's, like I said, probably going to be in the Hall of Fame.
Always a pleasure to get those veterans on.
Biz, I know you had something for us.
Well, I was going to organically transition this ad read,
but I think that after last episode's transition,
RA is feeling a little bit threatened.
So here we go.

Bow to me. The ad read god.
Phase 3 coming
Thursday. 2B.
Good stuff with Patrick
Malo. Funny to hear him mention
that he wishes he got
into the newer wheels earlier
because that was a grind that we talked about many times in the spas
when the Reeboks ran out, Paddy was donezo.
So he's finally switched, but I was interested to hear about that
because I'm a former shitty skate guy.
So he was talking about Joe and how he helped him when he moved over.
I actually filmed something.
I didn't know Joe Thornton was down with the content,
but Budweiser ended up talking him in. Me, him, and burnsy filmed something with a guy named matt dean pettit he's
a chef and they did a burger cook-off against each other it was cool uh burnsy i'm not saying
that i'm gonna have to watch it for yourself i came out already burnsy was on his 400 acre ranch
and joe thornton was at his place in San Jose with
a beautiful view and it was cool.
Joe's like the man.
Burnsy won because he killed the cow
and then he got the meat and then
he literally made the burger. Spoiler!
Spoiler! It gets a little gory
with the Budweiser content.
No, but it was cool. I mean,
I didn't feel like throwing out the hey, come on,
check out sometime because I didn't want to get denied.
You know, they say never talk to your idols.
So maybe we can get him on one day.
I think he would be such an interesting guy,
and everything has great things to say about him, including Patty Marlowe.
Yeah, absolutely.
Hopefully someday.
And that should probably wrap it up for this one, I'd say, boys.
I would say tune in to all our social channels.
We've got a lot of good stuff dropping this week, as we've been doing all
summer. Grinnelly's been busting his hump, doing a lot of
