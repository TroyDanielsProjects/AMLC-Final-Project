Hello everybody, welcome to episode 440 of Spittin' Chicklets, presented by Pink Whitney,
from our friends at New Amsterdam Vodka, here in the Barstool Sports Podcast family.
We're a week into the playoffs, out of control, so many overtimes, we just left the Bruins game, they lost.
I don't know what to fucking say right now, let's say hi to the boys first, I'm a little flustered.
Matt Merles, what's shaking on you, buddy?
Not much.
I got my Avs jersey on.
I know Whit hates it that I wear game jerseys to the games,
but the Avs are on tonight, and I need a big night from 29,
so I got the jersey on.
I thought I was going to be wearing the crown of worst take in Spittin' Chicklets history for a while.
You still are.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You picked a team that broke every single record
in the history of the league to miss the playoffs.
I said something that, while being very unpopular,
has backers.
You had no backers.
You had nothing but absolute horrible information to give us.
Mine was an L take in some respects, but we'll get to it.
Yours is the biggest loser take in the history of this show,
and it'll forever be that way, busy boy boy what you don't understand is it's not us who decides it's
the fans who decide and as far as engagement i got i got backers buddy you could it doesn't matter
buddy you got ratioed doesn't matter you have nothing you got ratioed harder than anybody has
ever been ratioed on the spit and chiclets channel.
That right there.
The Pasha situation is such a distant memory at this point. You're just so obsessed with the internet and the comments.
And I go by real life.
And look, you're laughing.
You live on the internet.
That's your world.
You wouldn't know what real life is if it fucking slapped you in the face.
It was on the internet.
Ah.
I live in the real world, and I got backers.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
Because the real world is blue-collar fans.
It may be my own little real world, but it's a real world.
The real world is blue-collar fans rocking jerseys to the game,
representing their favorite players,
and paying the salaries of these hard-working guys on the ice.
And once again, you wouldn't know anything about the common man.
And that's why you have the biggest L take in Spittin' Chicklets history.
And if you don't believe me, let's leave it to the people to decide.
Why don't you do a Twitter poll, G?
But once again, it's not going to matter because Witt doesn't listen to the real people on
this planet, just that fake little world he's living in.
I wore that L on my forehead, the Boston take,
but for you to not say that that's the biggest L take,
R.A., I'll throw it to you.
You're the blue-collar man.
I want you to stick up for our blue-collar listeners.
Was that not the biggest L take in Spitton?
Say blue-collar again.
I will.
I mean, there's a zillion nominees.
I mean, I've said dumb shit.
We've all said dumb shit in the show.
I think we'd have to see a full list, but I don't know. It's possible
the program. I mean, bad take.
I'm probably the king of them right now.
Shocker. R.A. being impartial.
Merle, let's throw it to you.
I didn't realize it.
I don't know. You said the Bruins weren't going to make the playoffs, Biz.
It's just tough to fucking fight with that.
You're fighting. You're fighting.
You're fighting a battle with an avalanche coming down
in your face. You said the Bruins are going to miss the playoffs.
You're trying to deflect.
You said the best team in the history of the sport is going to miss the playoffs.
Well, they might lose in the first round now, so.
All right, now that I think about it, maybe I haven't been dethroned.
No, we'll get into the jersey thing.
An amazing online debate, but way more important things uh i would say going on yeah
the bruins that that's an issue right now um merles your gambling show though is red hot yeah
the show is doing great all our guests are doing great too we just had fights on today he comes up
with the idea to do a bet where you can bet on berger on the score from the bumper never even
heard of this i was trying to get odds on it for him, but I couldn't find it.
Bergeron scored from the bumper. That was
amazing. It's been a blast getting on there.
The fans get in on the chat.
It's so much fun
talking with them. It's been great.
Chuck got the game winner, correct?
I had to leave.
Weren't you at the game?
We were recording at 10, so I had to leave.
Priorities, buddy. I left the game early because I didn't want to be late for recording.
I started to go on the TV, but I was setting shit up.
But just as that shit ended, I mean, regardless of who you're rooting for,
you hate to see a game end with a fucking pair of pizzas like that, no?
Oh, it's just a horrible ending.
We'll kind of get more in-depth to it.
But the fact that there was a chance for it to be the exact opposite in Bruins fans' minds and Bruins regulation bettors with almost the most
epic ending to a series I can ever remember. Like I would have bet anything he was going to score
on that breakaway, Marchand. And he had time to go to his backhand and put in his five hole,
which he always does. I think the announcer said it maybe. And boom, Bobrovsky steals the game and they're alive.
That's 11th overtime game, at least four game sixes, no sweeps yet.
Tons of stuff going on.
Biz, has there been a team that surprised you a ton or disappointed you a ton so far
in the playoffs?
Yeah, I'd like to just kind of get into the leafs chatter right now right off the
hop like let's fucking maybe get her going here yeah that's absolutely i mean an epic comeback
they're so used to having a that move done on them leafs down by three goals they tie it up
winning overtime have a 3-1 lead over tampa right now i mean there must be hot odds all over ontario
right now biz they stole one they didn't win either of those games in Tampa Bay,
but the core four has now been activated.
And look out, Tampa.
I'm saying Leafs and five, 100.
And obviously we're going to get into the bunting stuff
and the Derek Lalonde stuff.
Did you guys get any of that media situation?
So fill everyone in, and then I can give you my opinion.
So people didn't know about this.
So even I said, and I think we had a bit of a disagreement,
that Riley goal looked a little bit soft in overtime
after they tied it up late by Riley in game three,
and then it was a seeing eye shot as they snapped it back off the draw.
Riley takes a step to the left and ends up finding that top corner.
Well, you see the tying goal as time was winding down there in game four when Riley, once again, at the blue line,
uses JT in front of the net as a screen. He gets a second goal of the playoffs, and Vasilevsky's
having a hard time tracking it. And then on top of that, you see the OT goal where, I mean, it's
hard to blame him on that one. That's a point shot and a crossbody tip from Kerfoot, but Sportsnet
hired Derek Lalonde to go on to do analysis during the
playoffs and I was shocked to see the clip because you almost feel like he's throwing the coach's
room under the bus and maybe when you're hired by Sportsnet you maybe feel a little bit of pressure
in that moment to provide insight and say something with context well he goes on to say you know as a
team when he was there analytically they discovered that
point shots were one of the Vasilevsky was one of the weakest goalies in the league when facing
like distant point shots he was having a hard time tracking the puck so what they did is side right
blocker side I think it really pertained to everything but maybe more so blocker side
and that they'd started adjusting
their their the way they defended in order to protect him from that hole in his game well
buddy Chernak's out of the lineup McDonough's no longer around maybe they just don't defend it the
way that they used to do and it just seems that all of a sudden all these point shots are killing
them right now like you even go back to to game two off of that face-off play
where it goes D to D over to Marner.
I didn't think that was a great goal either.
And I think we can all agree on probably the reason
that Tampa Bay finds themselves in this hole right now,
although outplaying the Toronto Maple Leafs,
is Vasilevsky for the first time in a very long time
is now looking normal.
He's looking like a normal goalie if anything below average and there
was actually a comment in the media scrum where all right I'll throw it over to you and it has to
do with Vasilevsky and him not being able to track these distant shots so maybe there is some weight
to what Derek Lalonde saying but then to fire back Koop has a press conference they bring it up
and he had some choice words for not only the situation,
but also Lalonde.
Yeah, because Vassie also said that he wanted some x-ray glasses
to play the position lately, which, you know,
that's kind of a funny thing for a goalie to say.
I don't think it's indicative of his confidence,
but, I mean, the fact that he even says that, I don't know.
He's struggling.
Well, a couple things.
It's either he's trolling Derek Lalonde back,
or he's kind of taking a self-deprecating jab at himself,
which I think he's got an incredible personality.
I just don't know about Vasilevsky's post-game scrums
and whether he's one to really throw jabs at himself
or keep it light after a situation
where now you're down 3-1 in a series.
So a pretty crazy situation,
and Merle, I'll throw it over to you guys.
I almost feel bad for Derek Lalonde because it doesn't seem like he's the type of guy to want to do things like that,
but do you think he just succumbed to the pressure of being on national TV and wanting to say something of substance there?
I could totally see that because you get on there, and it's just so different.
The red light turns on, and and it's just so different my like the red light turns on i just
remember my first time you are definitely nervous and then they go to you to ask you certain aspects
of around the league certain plays and yeah i mean maybe you do want to sound or give a clip
that's that's pretty noticeable and gets people talking and is actually like truly in-depth
information i still probably wouldn't have said it just because I think,
I feel like they're probably so close.
If that is true, like I just probably wouldn't want to give away stuff that I won a Stanley Cup, you know, giving away secrets that guys have
that I won Stanley Cups with.
Does that make sense to you?
All right, what are you laughing at?
No, it's funny because I texted Luzzi earlier.
I don't really want to directly quote him because I didn't ask permission for it.
But basically, I think what he said was something that 9,000 analysts have already said about Vassie.
But because he's Lalonde and he's put it in very direct words, people are like, oh, my God, he threw him under the bus.
But these analysts measure every goal, where it comes from, all this stuff.
He didn't really blow any secrets.
He just kind of said.
But he did say what the point shots yeah that's been brought up but i was
interested to say how he he said that they changed certain coverage and defense wise like to try to
help him with that like that's almost like oh well we had to do this like it just i don't know it's
just funny to hear a coach of a team a former coach of a team talk like that
i'm happy he did because it is just interesting and and biz like you talk about my my jersey take
yeah like overall and l big time but my leaf sticks i mean i'm like a cross between like
steven ace no steven a is great i'm a cross between like Skip Bayless, Colin Cowher, and a sprinkle of Steve Simmons with my leaf sticks right now.
Jesus Christ.
I mean, that night was  I got lippy, and I got cocky when it was 4-1.
And then a couple minutes into the third, I'm just like, I'm going.
And next thing you know, two, I go downstairs.
I'm downstairs putting.
Three, I got to go downstairs. I'm downstairs putting. Three,
I gotta go back upstairs to the coach.
And by the way, after every goal before the next one, they were
dominating. Like, when they made it 4-3,
it was just a matter of time until they were making it
4-4. Like, they just, Tampa couldn't
do a thing. And Vasilevsky,
what's he giving up? 19 goals?
Now in four? He's 1-3
right now. He's not just average.
It's not dealing with an average Vasilevsky.
He's bad.
4-3-3 goals against 8-5-6 save percentage.
The last two games, he's given up nine goals on 64 shots.
I mean, this is all-time bad shit from him.
I mean, he's obviously a great goalie.
His record speaks for itself.
But I don't know if it's just the wear and tear of the last few years.
But, man, he's been rough sled man.
That's why they're down 3-1 right now, I think.
I mean, in the first two periods,
like Hagel did an interview during the second intermission
basically being like, we got these guys on the ropes
the way that they were playing.
Their extended core, their depth.
I thought Killorn, he looked like he got shot out of a cannon
and a big reason why they ended up taking that 4-1 lead.
But what happens with the Leafs,
and if you watch them during the regular season sometimes,
it's like they'll be non-existent for two periods.
But because of this core four and the skill that they have, all of a sudden things can change on a dime.
And I know I was hard on Brody the game before.
But on that second goal, you see him make that quick up play.
And then that's what gets those top end guys activated.
That exchange between Marner, Nylander, and Matthews,
it was a quick drop pass from Nylander to Marner,
one-touch pass over, and then a fucking beautiful wrister there by Matthews.
He doesn't miss in that slot area.
And then once they scored that goal, all of a sudden you saw that life come out.
The pressure, nobody's talking enough about the pressure in these playoffs.
And once the team starts scoring, you start looking at the clock,
and you see it tonight too.
There's been two closeout games.
Neither team's been able to close it out.
That pressure is just building on guys, and that's what happened.
Toronto scored, and then Tampa's like, oh, no, we're going to blow this again,
and they did.
And you talk about pressure.
How about that core four, and it really, in those situations
over the course of the last two games
when they were getting dominated, I said it on the broadcast,
they couldn't break the puck out.
They couldn't get any type of forecheck going
or really get any type of offensive zone sustained pressure, right?
So all of a sudden, like these guys look non-existent.
If they end up losing the series, what's going to be the headlines?
Marner and Matthews can't get it done.
They took too much money.
They're selfish.
The JT signing was shit.
Who are we getting rid of?
Nylander or Marner?
Well, those are the fucking guys
who end up getting it done
and then they get the power play
to make it 4-3.
And that fucking sauce by Nylander,
I know it was a UFO
when that thing was hovering.
It never touched the ice.
Matthews on the hands team,
that was about, what,
18 inches off the ice.
He tips it out of the air perfectly and then that's when you had that feeling they were going to fucking
come back in that game. And it comes down to those offensive zone draws and the fact that they,
when they can't get that sustained pressure in the offensive zone, it's always been those ozone
draws that's led them to success. They had the tying goal, or excuse me, the winning goal by O'Reilly, snapping it back to Riley. And in this situation,
Anson and I believe it was Panger on the broadcast pointed out. So late in that third period,
in order to tie the game, they ended up sending out O'Reilly and Tavares on the offensive zone
draw because as the first guy, Tavares going in, you can be way more aggressive about going into the
face-off. And if you end up getting pinched for it and you get kicked out, at least you still have
a good centerman in O'Reilly. So a great coaching move by Keefe to do that. Well, fucking Tavares
ends up snapping it back. It was a bobbled play and who comes through in the clutch on the wall?
Mitch Marner. It was a two-on-one. He had two guys closing in on him.
He wins that battle. It gets back to
Riley. He walks a line. Beautiful
net front screen by JT,
and he fucking ties that game up, and there is not
a doubt in my mind that they're winning that
fucking hockey game after they tied that game up.
Tampa Bay was shook. As
I told you guys, Dubas was given the double
barrel on the way out. What do you mean there
wasn't a doubt in your mind?
You go to overtime, you have no idea.
You have no idea.
You can't say.
The Bruins were shooting them 40 to 18.
There might have been a doubt in your mind.
You're an OT, dude.
There's a doubt in your mind.
Let's be honest.
There might have been a doubt in your mind, but there wasn't a doubt in my mind.
And what did they do?
They fucking pulled a rabbit out of their ass and win the game.
Why are you rolling your eyes?
mind and what do they do they fucking pull the rabbit out of their ass and win the game why are you rolling your eyes any single hockey fan in the world whose team is in the stanley cup playoffs
when they go to overtime has a slight doubt in their mind are you in my brain yeah i'm right in
your brain i've always been there since i've met you too good luck with that well these fans are
different all right okay all right yeah is there doubt in your mind any overtime game the Bruins go into?
What are you asking that guy for?
He didn't even fucking
He went to the fucking game. He didn't even know who scored.
He didn't even know who scored the
goddamn game-winning goal.
Honestly, no. I was getting the shit
set up. Dude, I had to leave the game at 9.30.
I didn't want to be late and fuck everything up.
And I was watching it. I just didn't see the whole
play before it got precipitated. But I did see that the Bruins fucked it up royally.
The bad play, two pizzas.
Whoever did it, I just didn't catch the numbers.
They fucked it up.
You know what?
Biz was right.
No doubt.
He's right.
Biz right now and the Toronto Maple Leafs are just hovering above the 20 years of mediocrity
and shit.
You're just above it.
There's like a white light.
And everything's coming up roses. the 20 years of mediocrity and shit. You're just above it. There's like a white light.
And everything's coming up roses.
All I'm saying is the hardest one to get is that fourth one.
And they're going against champions.
And I felt as though Leafs Nation is like we won the series.
You guys tell me if I'm wrong.
Well, guess what, Dickhead?
We did it.
There's no doubt in my mind they're going to win in five at home. How about that? Is that good enough for you, Witt?
Or do you want to go back to the OT
winner, Kerfoot? A guy who's been getting
a lot of criticism from
Leafs nations, along with
Morgan Riley during the regular season.
They pull a rabbit out of their ass in
Tampa. They get both wins down there.
They had no business doing, and it's all because
of the core four getting activated.
And then more drama ensues now that Bunting's off of suspension.
They announced, Keefe, that they're not going to put him in the lineup.
Now, I was just surprised.
Were you surprised? Because I wasn't.
Yeah, I was a bit surprised.
I had no doubt he wasn't going back in, actually.
Oh, not one little bit of doubt?
Not even anything, because nize is that good
he's that much better than him nize he wouldn't be taking nize on the lineup hey hey whoa whoa
i want to start if i can if i can rebuttal yeah i think you're being paid by the leafs so go ahead
49 points this regular season and i know it's not the regular season 23 goals yeah i think a guy
who's been resting the last three games and probably has
his legs and he's ready to go because he's been in the gym and you know what it's like when you
get the three games off or you don't have those bumps and bruises that the other guys have from
battling along the walls what has been a few of their their biggest problems maybe not winning
enough battles specifically on the four check what does he do well? That, problem breaking out of their own end.
He's really good on the half-falls as well.
It's not just the goals and the offense that he brings,
it's the other intangibles.
On top of getting under other opponents' skin,
like we saw in game two by obviously going over the line.
So am I shocked to see a 23-goal scorer
who's fresh and ready to go coming off suspension
who, remind you, he did the Leafs a
favor by taking Chernak out of the lineup like let's not kid ourselves here I'm not I know you
laugh I'm not saying it was hey I'm not saying it was clean and I'm not being a dirtbag because
obviously I feel bad that Chernak's out of the lineup but don't tell me that hasn't been a huge
hole for the Tampa Bay Lightning as far as boxing guys out in the net front sounds like you have inside info that there was a lot of intent to injure there and that
it was all on purpose.
That's what it sounds like.
And my other thing to you in the lineup thing, you've been around.
You played long enough.
Merles, how many times were you like, if we win and I'm sitting out, I'm not going back
in?
They never change a winning lineup.
Nowhere.
You have to be a really special player to come back in after winning.
Look at the Bruins.
Your Bruins shouldn't have done it.
I think there would be plenty.
Oh, you're going to set out Bergeron?
Yeah, winning lineup.
Yeah, health bomb Bergeron.
Yeah, that's worse than fucking maybe sitting them out game 82 if you wanted to.
So I will say I think there's plenty of examples out there of guys being inserted into the lineup
where coaches aren't superstitious like that they more just make the intelligent move of putting the best players
possible on the ice you don't you don't plan for now you plan for the future of where you want to
be this is a little bit of tension so maybe you and leaf station are now butting heads as to should
bunting be around if they lose now it's a big story no because if you were to let me finish
what the fuck i was talking about i would have said but when you were talking so i thought you were done
like a like a like a classy guy bunting got the information he says obviously i want to be in the
lineup but my job's not to be poopy pants my job's to be a supportive teammate and support the guys
who get the nod and are in the lineup and i'll be waiting for my number to be called which will be
game one of the second round against the boston bruins they don't blow it. And it's nice to see that the Toronto Maple Leafs are going to
win this thing in five games and get some much needed rest over the weekend in order to go into
that series. I'm not getting too ahead of myself, but I'm very confident they're going to close that
thing out at home, learning from their experience of the past and not being able to button things
up in closing games. So great job all around. I get it.
Don't change a winning lineup. They went that route. I'm going to act exactly like bunting and
say, Hey, let's get the job done. I'm not going to be poopy pants. I don't, I don't care to be
right. I just care to win the fucking hockey game. Anything else on Tampa Bay boys? Guys,
real quick, before we move on from Toronto, I think Ryan O'Reilly one has been absolutely incredible. But I saw this video that's going viral around the internet that he changes
his gloves during a game every five to 10 minutes. Have you guys ever seen a player changes equipment
that often? Is that common? Ray Bork had six pairs for every period. My brother was a trainer
there and he would have to that was his job was to change them that much. It was insane. He would
do two shifts, I think, and then have to have them dry.
I was a pigeon, so they wouldn't give me more than one pair.
And they tried to keep the budget down in Arizona.
But usually the skill guys, and you can attest to this, it's nice.
Because usually at the TV timeouts, the trainer comes over,
and he gives you those nice toasty mitts.
And you have the brand new warm gloves, and they're dry.
And then your stick is sticking perfectly to your glove where you can feel a little lighter somehow oh it just
feels stronger yeah i i mean for me i had holes in my palms before they give me new i can tell
you a quick story about that it happened to me my second nhl game i was in overtime and i was
leaking and i was too afraid to ask for the second pair especially in pittsburgh at that time there
wasn't money for anything i think they were were Mario's old gloves I had to use.
And I went to shoot in overtime and my hand slipped.
And I remember saying that to somebody and they're like,
it's the NHL, dude.
You can have two pairs.
I'm like, oh, really?
Like I was just so dumb and naive.
But yeah.
And then McKinnon stole your number.
By the way, in Merle's mind, had he asked for the second pair,
he scores there.
He stays up the rest of the year.
He ends up signing a four-year deal.
That's how it always  it's a snowball effect.
Yeah, but then I wouldn't be here.
I'd be on an island somewhere gambling on these games and playing craps.
So everyone works out for a reason.
That's when people say, do you regret boozing that entire time you were in the NHL
and basically your career dwindling and you being pigeon-tossed?
And I say, yeah, I think about sometimes how I could have extended it,
but then again, I wouldn't have been an idiot online tweeting
and getting drunk and, I guess, talking about some of the tomfoolery
that went on in those days on the podcast,
and we wouldn't be able to sit here and stroke off the Leafs.
So all is good in Leaf land.
Looking forward to that game five.
I think we moved on from the Leafs, guys, didn't we?
Didn't that already happen when we went to Colorado?
Did you watch the game?
Did you have anything to chime in with?
Is there any nuggets you want to drop, R.A.?
I have a nugget.
It wasn't from the game.
It was someone's father or uncle or whatever watching the game.
I think it was a TikTok.
And they just taped him saying, fuck, shit, go, like every fucking two seconds.
He was drinking a Timmy Hortons.
And they ended up winning the game.
It's in the outline if you didn't see it.
It's so fucking funny.
I'll describe it better.
So there was a 55-year-old father wearing a Leafs jersey,
Tim Hortons cup, and the kids videoing him the entire time.
And like most Leafs fans, they've been through so much pain,
the negativity throughout the game,
and how shit they were playing through the first 40 minutes.
So you just have fucking him motherfucking every single player and then the progression of them
starting to come back and then him turning into the biggest Leafs jock jock stiffer and then pumping
everybody's tires by the end of the video and then this year's the year to go on where they're going
to win the Stanley Cup I thought we were going to talk about the guy. Was that the guy screaming? He was screaming behind the glass after they won.
He was the basic person in my mind when I thought,
I think they think they won the series.
I don't know if this guy knows.
He was interviewed on Breakfast Television in Toronto.
That was a different guy.
That was a different guy.
He reminded me of the girl when Trump got elected.
I was like, nah.
Nah.
He was the Leafs version of that guy.
And I was like, I think he thinks it's three out of five back in the day.
But some amazing reactions.
I didn't see that TikTok.
I got to check that one out.
I mean, Biz, you described the game.
It's just my thought is, yeah, I will be shocked if the Leafs lose this series.
Even being the Leafs, I'll be shocked. But lose the next this series even being the Leafs I'll be shocked
but lose the next one you're going back to Tampa and then lose that one and then they're losing
if this goes to seven the Leafs are losing we know that so you gotta close them out at home
the Bruins just they're getting on a plane to Florida tomorrow now that's a pain in the ass
guys need rest you better get it done Thursday and I can't be a hypocrite because, R.A., I gave it to you a little bit about pulling Allmark for Swayman.
I was ready to pull the plug on Samsonov because I wasn't crazy about some of the goals.
But, hey, when the chips are on the table, specifically in that third period in overtime,
he held the fort and didn't really allow much by him and really did a good job.
So I'm actually excited they kept him in.
I said they should go to Wall.
That was my bad.
So I'm going to eat that one and we can move on.
Before we continue, guys, I'm here to talk to you about Pink Whitney.
And no matter where you are, Sweden, where Merle's is, where the sun's already up,
or Boston, where the weather's finally turned. Nothing beats being outside, being on the
golf course, being at the beach. That's coming soon. Sipping on some Pink Whitney. Watching a
playoff game, pouring a nice cold Pink Whitney over ice, maybe throwing a little soda water in
there. That's what it's all about come springtime. I was just playing golf the past two days.
We had Pink Whitney flowing. We had the nips going for the birdies. That's what it's all about, the birdie juice, Pink Whitney.
And we appreciate you guys drinking it and enjoying it just like we do here on this podcast.
So shout out to Pink Whitney and go get some today.
Okay, boys.
We got to go L.A., Edmonton, the hockey world.
One small step closer to the greatest player on the planet right now, getting to the grandest stage.
There's a long way to go in the Stanley Cup.
I think everybody wants to see McDavid in the Cup.
Well, they beat L.A. 6-3, took a 3-2 series lead.
McDavid, two assists.
I mean, hitman's Leon of biz.
I want to ask, how often would you go to those guys on the same line?
Just when you're desperate or if you want to build the lead?
If you're coaching those guys, why wouldn't you play them more often together?
I ain't the Edmonton guy.
We're going to throw this over to Witt.
You know what I'm going to say about it?
You're trying to throw that to him after he gets to talk about the Leafs that long?
That was disgraceful.
And my team had just as big of a win?
I was like, that black guy gift, putting it in his head.
I'm just going to say this as I hand it over.
McDavid and Dreisaitl are the biggest dynamic duo since Pippen and Jordan.
Oh, we're not staying in hockey?
I mean Jager and Lemieux maybe?
If they win a Stanley Cup Dreisaitl and McDavid are the greatest dynamic duo
In sports since Pippen and Jordan
Bigger than Shaq and Kobe?
If they win a Stanley Cup
Connor McDavid and Leon Dreisaitl
Are the best dynamic duo
In sports since Pippen and Jordan You guys want me to say it one more fucking time? They win a Stanley Cup. Connor McDavid and Leon Dreisaitl are the best dynamic duo in sports
since Pippen and Jordan.
You guys want me to say it one more fucking time?
None of those other four threw each other under the bus like.
RA, you said McDavid.
We've talked about McDavid.
You really cannot say enough.
There's only so much to be said.
You have to see it to believe it.
But, and there's a big but here,
right now the greatest player on the planet is Leon Dreisaitl.
Oh, yeah.
This guy is so unbelievable.
I think he's now second all-time points per game in the playoffs.
He is so dominant that he gets the puck in the defensive zone,
he skates it out.
Every time.
Doesn't matter. Then he gets it in the offensive zone he skates it out every time doesn't matter then he gets it
in the offensive zone at times and guys bounce off him then he has this paddle this long ass
as biz calls him the right winger in bubble hockey with the extra long stick
and he fires backhand missile passes right on guy's tape he protects the puck. He's just, it's the fact they have him and Connor is
just, they, they, they are a great hockey team. And what did I say, guys? I said, you go back to
Skinner. You go back to Skinner. And I was scared. I was scared. The second, you know, they come out
flying and he, you know, all of a sudden it's 3-2 Kempe too Kempe
if the Oilers somehow lose this series it'll be Kempe who kills him in game seven that guy he I
didn't even realize by the way so much for being a hockey analyst he had 41 goals this year I would
have guessed he had like 33 41 and then in the playoffs he comes alive as well but the Oilers
the only thing I didn't understand prior to the game was
they were minus two-third Kings are plus 180 I'm like this is so and all series they have been big
favorites at home Vegas loves the Oilers but I almost was more confident because the line was
so ridiculous biz as a non-gambler do you know what I mean by that uh I was on game notes and
I said I knew that the they were going to win by two I said the Oilers were going to win 5-3 I said 5-3 almost hit it right right on I had a feeling in my gut and it's just
after that 3-0 blown lead by the LA Kings I just feel like the the series has completely shifted
into Edmonton's favor specifically because LA is unable to stay disciplined against them
and like the regular season, and sometimes in playoffs,
you're playing against teams who have better penalty kills.
Most of the teams in playoffs have better special teams.
But nothing is slowing down this Edmonton power play.
I describe the Leafs offense as like a beautiful symphony,
like an orchestra, a beautiful ballet.
It's unworldly right now.
It's like a, maybe it's like a ballet that has like six
people there and they they meet once a week that's a that's the leafs offense compared to the oilers
is like the russian ballet was that the good ballet the russian cracker
nutcracker christmas time everyone loves going to see that. Great call. I will be an honest fan.
That was like the worst game I've ever seen the Kings play.
They were horrible.
You've got to give LA, I mean, Edmonton credit, they came up buzzy.
LA looked horrific.
That'll be game six, you'll see a completely different team.
But yeah, when Leon is playing like this, and Connor I think has eight or nine points in
five games maybe eight like people are like oh he hasn't taken over a game it's like he has eight
points I mean and and Leon is just at another level it's it's it's all about like those two
guys but you're never gonna win and that's been the complaint they're a two-team guy without the
depth scoring and people were kind of calling out Kane and Hyman and Nuge,
and these guys, now they're going.
And Kane's playing injured.
He's battling something lower body, I think.
He was, like, flexing the knee one game,
but he starts it off with that snipe, just a sick shot, top right power play.
L.A., once again, like, their power play's just standing there.
I mean, they're PK.
And then Hyman, who the guy's been so good since he
came to edmonton wow unreal throat god he's on the score to go off his adams apple and he gets a puck
a bouchard slap shot off the chin and it goes in you mean the throat that's how this guy plays
now granted he was standing there and got hit with a slap shot and bouchard whiffed on it didn't get
tipped if bouchard got that thing full cancanned, it somehow hit him, he's probably dead.
He has a rocket.
So everything is coming together.
I mean, that was the most complete game they've played.
It looks like they'll get Vegas next round, but I am not at all as confident,
as busy as with the Leafs, that the Oilers get this done next game.
I mean, I said seven.
I think L.A. gets to win.
I hope not.
But Edmonton's coming.
They're coming, boys.
Much like we're going to pump Don Sweeney's tires later, Merles,
is you just have to look at not only the trades but the free agency signings.
Even in that game four when Jack Campbell comes in and saves the day,
he was the first player signed
in free agency you talked about hyman and them going to get him the deadline deal for ekholm
they've now surrounded all these players with competent guys who when they need to play and
they need it most they can rely on guys other than connor mcdavid and leon dry sidle despite
what they're fucking doing right now that they needed that forever. They needed the stay-at-home defensive defenseman that they could rely on.
Nurse is not that guy.
Eckholm is that guy.
He takes care of, he makes up for all the mistakes.
They can run and gun all they want.
He takes care of that.
And that was the biggest signing and the biggest difference
from this year's team and last year's team.
And that Bouchard too, Whit.
Holy fuck.
What's up?
Bouchard.
Oh, yeah, the guy's awesome. And that's a lot to do with that comb but also i think the confidence of barry leaving and him
taking over the number one pp like you just feel you feel better i mean he's an offensive guy he's
a high pick like to now be snapping around on that power play you're getting your one-timers it just
for me as a player when i was on if my, I loved when my first shift was a power play.
You get time with the puck, you get confidence,
and then everything kind of flows into the rest of your game.
And that's what's happened with Bouchard.
My buddy, too, Tafel, he texted me a video from the game.
We have to get back to Edmonton.
I mean, you remember that, guys.
That atmosphere.
McDavid scored 50 seconds at the Game 3 Western Conference Finals.
Wow.
But he sent me the video of the rink the other night.
And right as the Oilers are coming out, right before they leave the dressing room,
on the huge big screen, just a state-of-the-art hell of an arena,
the Oilers' locker room door opens and Enter Sandman starts.
And everyone knows Mariano Rivera from the New York Yankees.
And the boys start coming
out and this place was going bonkers I had a full-on chubby I was sitting there watching a
video all right my wife would have thought I was on some bad bad site but no I was just watching
the Oilers walking out to the arena in game five first round not enough not to mention so I can't
wait to get back and and and if people do want to see greatness
or basically a lifelong dream come true
as a spit and chiclets listener,
give me Leafs Oilers in the cup final.
And Biz, I don't know if we'd be friends after.
That would be the greatest thing that ever happened to me,
to see you two going head to head, the two super fans.
I would wear a jersey every single game.
The best American player versus the best Canadian player.
I'd be wearing a dusty jersey.
I'd get a Korean Oilers thong.
Yeah, for your two-minute minor session in the mornings,
you'd be going doggy style looking at McDavid's name bar.
No, I'm a 30-second because they score on the PP
and I'm out of the box.
Boston, you're not while looking at a McDavid name bar.
As you'd be in another hotel just getting bent over and thumped yourself by Austin.
Hey, you're just holding the fighting strap while giving it to Bree with the Dreisaitl name bar in your face.
Oh, shit.
Oh, baby, we got Pablo.
Merles, let me ask you, do you think the Kings are toast?
I think they were done.
That didn't look good last night.
I've been proud of the Kings.
I like them.
I love Kempe.
I love little Arvidsson, this little Swede.
He's great.
But I think they're done now.
That was just a dominating performance.
Now they're getting the rest.
So now Connor and Dries can play even more minutes next game.
It's three, four days off.
So last year it was L.A. who was up 3-2,
and then Edmonton did the Mongolian reversal.
This year it's Edmonton 3-2 going back to L.A.
You know Will Ferrell's going to have the war paint on.
He's got to go back to the white on white he had game three.
He's got to go to the checkerboard face.
He's got to go to checkerboard face, not the 50-50 split.
So it's definitely going to be an interesting game six.
But as I've said, the biggest win for me probably this postseason so far
until the Leafs close out in five is you admitting how big of an idiot you were
not being a little bit fearful of the LA Kings
and coming off of that stance.
How many times are we going to go over this?
What do you mean?
I just quickly mentioned it on the way up.
You said I should be very scared.
You said very scared.
I go, I'm not scared of anyone.
Do I know LA's a good team like i think
we're gonna do this we'll just do it up till free agency we'll just do i'll go over what i said
okay i'm not scared of anyone i knew they were a good team not scared of anyone all right what
you got for us uh hold up last thing on because those two series whatever we're moving on the
fact we got to see two three goal comebacks comebacks from both teams, bing-bang like night after night, that just shows you're never out of these games.
It's wild.
And why I think it's so magical, it's almost like that 19-year reversal
of when in the last five minutes of that playoff game,
what was it, 2013 against the Boston Bruins,
when Boston was down 4-1 to the Toronto Maple Leafs
and they came storming back.
I feel like that's their curse of the Bambino type thing
where this 4-1 swing back the other way to beat the Lightning
is the reversal of that as well.
So that's why I just got this positive juju
and these positive thoughts for the boys in blue moving forward.
I never heard that story before, Biz.
Why don't you tell me?
Which one?
The 4-1 comeback lead?
4-1, 3-1.
Hey, I mean, we got to talk about Corpozalo too. We were stroking him off, rightfully so,
but he's kind of fallen off quite a bit. He got
pulled the other night. They had to put in a
Copley Farm, Copley, however you want to say his name.
I don't know if he just kind of ran out of
steam or what. Also, the Edmondson
power play, 57.1.
The Jets,
second place Jets are 41.7.
That's just insane.
I mean, over 50 of a power play is fucking absolutely redonkulous.
Meanwhile, their penalty killing, 72.2.
Not as good, but I don't know.
Do you think penalty killing, I'm sorry, if your power play is that good,
can it offset shitty penalty killing in the long run?
Sure.
Okay.
Let's see.
Also, the Oilers, Biz, have three of the top five guys in points right now.
Leon's got 10.
Bouchard, we already talked about him, eight points.
He's been unreal.
Connor McDavid's got eight points as well.
So, I don't know.
It feels like they're doing a lot better 5-on-5 than people thought going into the series, Biz.
Before we go any farther, I want to talk to you about the score.

Yeah, we only really kind of glossed over the B's Florida.
It was such a stunning ending to that game.
I mean, Matthew Kachuk, like I said, he carried this team through the playoffs.
He's been getting it done, got the game winner tonight.
Even before that, man, I thought the Bruins had kind of crossed the Rubicon.
I thought they were going to be all set with this series.
But then Bob Rovsky comes back in, and he played his ass off tonight.
I think he had like 42-something shots on him.
Unbelievable game, and I don't know, Biz.
I think we've got a series now.
Do you think Florida's going to make a seven-game series out of this or what?
It's a whole new thing now.
Well, always difficult when a centerman of the magnitude of Bergeron
comes back in the lineup.
He has that huge tying power play goal.
Obviously helps him off in the face-off circle.
I think we saw it with Stone.
Sometimes when you're out for a little bit,
and he was obviously out longer,
it takes you one game to get your legs back underneath you
and everybody readjusted to whoever they're playing with on their wings.
I would imagine that they go down to Sunrise
and you see a lot better Boston team.
It comes back, though.
You talk about the catastrophic turnovers that they had in Game 2 at home.
And then going back to this one, even that first goal, Bertuzzi,
I didn't mind the play.
He throws it out front where I think that he thought McAvoy,
as that net front defenseman, was going to activate.
And sometimes he goes the other way.
I think he was expecting the bump behind the net.
That turnover ended up being costly.
But when they finally ended up tying up that game,
like Taylor Hall, he's playing like a man possessed right now.
And he obviously had some time off with his injury.
He looks fresh as hell.
He's skating the same way he did when he won the heart.
And right now he's been the best forward for this Boston Bruins team.
And all of a sudden you're seeing these older guys who, you know,
maybe struggled a little bit offensively compared to the past,
like guys like Tyler Sagan.
Well, Taylor Hall has taken the bull by the horns
and now has elevated this Boston Bruins team.
As far as the OT goal, another catastrophic turnover.
It's just a misread.
I don't know what the communication was.
I don't know why Allmark, considering he was on his forehand,
just doesn't rifle that puck around.
It goes back to the Winnipeg game.
Remember when I said Sandberg?
It's like you're in overtime, right?
Play a more simplistic style of game, especially on your breakouts,
where he could have just went up the wall to, I'm drawing a blank here, Kyle Conner.
Whereas if he just throws that around a wall instead of trying to make a cute play,
well, it doesn't get turned over and end up in the back of your net.
So I would imagine the Bs regroup, though, and they're going to be fine
just considering that they have a lot of guys in that lineup going and buzzing right now,
and their depth at a certain point just has to take over.
The whole play began.
McAvoy made an unreal play going down low,
and he went around the net,
and he almost created a grade-A scoring chance,
but then he kind of stayed down there.
And usually you kind of maybe want a guy to back up,
especially overtime.
Well, Marchand gets it in the corner.
He thinks Bergeron's still backing up
and taking McAvoy's place.
And he throws it to what would be his forehand.
And he had changed and Zaka had hopped on the ice,
which is his backhand being a lefty.
It gets by him.
And then when you go down
and you have that miscommunication,
like there's so many different sayings
you can have with a goalie and a defenseman.
It's strong side, weak side, play it, leave it, little things.
I don't know what was being said to him, but yeah, like you said, Biz,
it's on your forehand.
Rip that thing around the glass.
At worst case, it hits a guy in Florida on the shoulder,
and you can kind of reset, get in your defensive zone structure,
and figure it out.
But he just throws a weak backhand, goes in front, and Kachuk.
Once you saw it was him, he just weights it out, but he just throws a weak backhand, goes in front, and Kachuk, once you saw it was
him, he just waited out perfectly. Grizzly slid back, almost actually saved it with his face.
Boys, I actually have some audio of Paul Maurice talking about Matthew Kachuk. Do you guys want
to go to that right now? You mentioned Matthew Kachuk. Just what can you say from your vantage
point of what you saw as he was able to find the back of the net. That guy is a, and then you put a long string of profanity, gamer.
Is he not a gamer?
Like, I had times he did that in Calgary to us in Winnipeg.
Drived me crazy how he could just out of nowhere pull a puck.
So, I don't know, there's, what, 700 guys in the league.
640 of them jam that thing as fast they can't then that lose it and he pulls it across right he's got he's just a gamer but
the celebration by kachuk just showed that these guys believe they're alive i i still think the
bruins i mean beating them three in a row would be the most shocking thing I've ever seen.
So I think they'll be able to get this done.
But just the fact that you got injuries, you got guys battling,
you got to get on the flight to Florida, you got to go back,
play another game that's going to be the hardest game to win,
we've already said, and a huge wasted opportunity. Because to get back in the game, Cousa Halsey,
and shout out game four, he had two and two.
He was flying that game two.
And Ferraro on the broadcast was just talking about confidence and he actually made a good point he goes it's amazing
to think that these athletes the best in the world that what they do can can still lose their
confidence but you do and when you get to get some feels and you get it can be one nice rush
it can be one nice pass and things start clicking one nice pass, and things start clicking again. And so, yeah, luckily Halsey's playing this way, and he's carried them.
So they're going to go down to Florida.
I think they get it done there.
And if they don't, that's just the panic of a game seven.
It's like anything can happen.
There's worry.
There's doubt.
And to have it that close to be able to finish off with Marchand
with the puck on his stick, he's two away now from tying Cam Neely as the all-time playoff goal scoring leader for the Bruins
I I just thought he would bury that and and and now Bobrovsky's feeling it you've seen him you've
seen him upset teams before and they finally put him back in and this was the game and what did he
finish up with 45 saves yeah it was something 48 to 20 shots i want to say roughly i have no idea
but uh we had fights on today and he said a great line that taylor hall said he's like this isn't
going to be my best chance and ever like my only chance maybe ever to win the stanley cup and and
that's not lost on me and you can see he's playing like that like he knows he never had a chance
before and he might never get another one. He's all in on this series.
He's been their best player.
Well, I guess Marsh, he's been pretty good too, but they're good.
And I know I made fun of the Bertuzzi pass on a tweet that he got his assist,
hit his assist bonus or whatever, his sit prop.
But that's what Boston does.
They activate those D.
That's why they are so good.
Monte wants those D involved.
They want those risky passes into the middle.
And sometimes it ends up in your own net.
But that's how they play, and they'll be fine.
Any other takeaways from being live in action in the Garden?
I mean, the place was buzzing.
It had the electricity that you expect at a playoff game.
But, I mean, this team sort of just rope-a-doped them, Biz.
I mean, like, look at it. Bobrovsky stopped 44 out of 47 shots.
Going into the game, Florida's power play was only 4.8, which is terrible, and they won the
game, man. It's like they just take the punches, and they counterpunch, and they beat them, man.
I don't know. I'm not, like, worried, but I'm a little, like, leery. I don't know. If they go
down and lose this next game, anything can happen in a game seven, and if their power play is that
bad, and, you know, what's his name? Lyon in the first few games wasn't great, and they're still
this close in the series,
I don't know, man.
This could get hairy.
I don't like it, but we got to see what happens.
That's why they play the games.
The theme of the whole playoffs has been the road teams.
The road teams had a big winning streak.
I don't know the overall record, but tonight two more road teams are going to get it done,
and it's wild.
It's changed from our day when we were going on the road
and we were out drinking and, and not getting good sleep.
So now being on the road is an advantage.
You're getting,
you're getting the proper rest.
You're not going out,
running out and getting groceries.
You don't have the dog barking,
waking you up.
You know,
you're out there.
You're completely focused with the team.
And I think you're seeing that,
especially in this playoffs.

is probably going to move on. They're going to play the winner of Winnipeg-Vegas. Vegas has a 3-1 lead.
Merles, I'll go to you on this one first.
Does Winnipeg have the capability to come back?
Hellebeck hasn't looked good at all, man.
He's had a couple of rough games.
They're obviously missing a couple of guys.
What do you think is going to happen here, man?
Yeah, I denounced my Jets fandom.
They just have not looked like the team I thought they could be.
Scheifele's already out for Game 5.
Morrissey's out.
That's when I gave up on them. Ehlers,
Ehlers, I don't know how you say it. I'm terrible with names, even though his dad was my coach,
fun fact, the Swiss B League. They're done. Vegas is going to win tomorrow night. No question in my
mind, Vegas, and we're still alive for the Chicklets Vegas finals trip, baby. I know that
that's all you could think about. Those Jets injuries, just too
much to overcome. And I never would have guessed they didn't get one game at home. I mean, you
talk about crowds like the White-O, it's special. They got the outside drinking areas. It's just a
wild scene. It looks like I've never been to a playoff game there, but they had nothing.
to a playoff game there, but they had nothing.
Vegas has looked really good, actually.
The hard thing for me is this series is definitely the one I've seen the least amount of, and apparently the ratings are horrific, too.
Biz, you were saying probably because there's not really a superstar
on either team.
Well, you have two Western teams, one of which Canadian,
with no superstars.
I get the late games sometimes draw away from that, you know,
the analytic numbers on viewership,
but Winnipeg
is probably the smallest
of all the Canadian markets,
and the fact they don't really have a jump out
superstar is probably affecting the numbers, but
overall, though,
ever since game one, it's been all
Vegas. They got the cobwebs out, Stone
got his legs underneath him, he's been a fucking beast. Jack one, it's been all Vegas. They got the cobwebs out. Stone got his legs underneath him.
He's been a fucking beast.
Jack Eichel's been having his first playoff parade.
And then just like the, I mean, guys coming through in the clutch.
You saw Amadio score the game winner, first ever playoff goal for him.
Howden has a monster game.
The biggest thing for me, especially with Morrissey out of the lineup right now,
and I know Pionk's done a great job, is, and it could be more of a five-on-five defensive issue, is the way that they give up the blue line. Like, you even saw on that Howden goal as he comes in, like, he ends up burying it into the defenseman as he winds up and shoots it, but by the time he shoots it, that defenseman backed into basically the hash marks. So you're not only giving up these high-quality scoring chances
by backing in, but you're also screening your goalie, right?
Because you're so close to the net,
and then you're trying to go down and get the block.
But since you've already given up the line,
and sometimes people just want to bitch at the defenseman
about not gapping up properly,
but a lot of the time it has to do with your setup in the offensive zone
and maybe not having a responsible
enough f3 and then not having that back pressure on the way back so that defenseman can maintain
his gap where he has that confidence where yeah maybe he does get burned but he slows that forward
down enough like Howden coming down in that situation where if he rubs him out even a little
bit that forwards can swoop underneath them and then grab the puck and then get it back going the other way. So I noticed it on the Chandler-Stevenson goal that got things going
in game three as well in Winnipeg. But to allude to what you guys said, it sucks that they couldn't
take advantage of that home ice. It just, overall, the bottom six for me, the four check,
and the way that Vegas' D have finally become activated
and gotten more involved, example, Shea Theodore and Petrangelo,
that's why they've taken over the series.
They look like the far superior team,
and every time when they are in the defensive zone
and they do give up a high-quality scoring chance, Vegas,
who's there to get the block?
The two block leaders the entire NHL season are Alec Martinez and McNabb.
And you guys don't think that.
They have a winning pedigree coming from L.A.
So they knew what they were doing by acquiring those guys.
A great compliment to the offensive side of the D
on the right side of Petrangelo and Theodore.
And then you just got to look to the goaltending carousel
that ended up working out perfectly perfectly for him because Brassois has looked stellar
he's battled his dick off to come back from injury and get back to playing shape and he's
kicking him fucking just as good as just as good as goaltending as they've ever had and that's even
going back to flower when they made their run I'm happy happy for Eichel. It was pretty obvious to everyone
that's watched him. It was just a tough couple of years. He's just been through so much,
and Buffalo fans hate him, whatever. He finally gets to experience the playoffs. In the first
game, he was bad, had a bad game. It's a new game. It's different. And he's been great since. And in game four,
he had no points, but he was the best player on the ice. He drew two penalties. And I think he's
talking about finally realizing what it's like. He appreciates being there. And they have way
more depth. I mean, you kind of talked about they're getting contributions from everyone,
where Winnipeg loses a couple top guys and they're nowhere to be seen, the rest of the team.
And I picked Vegas.
I said the only chance Winnipeg had was Hellebuck just standing on his head,
and he's been pretty average too, like Vasilevsky.
You know what I mean?
Unless he was going to steal games, I didn't see them competing.
If I'm a betting man, they go back to Vegas and close things out.
But the two teams that have had 3-1 leads
have been unable to seal the deal at home.
Carolina, who I want to say had at least eight or nine straight playoff home wins,
and then Boston, who was this unbelievable clutch team, especially at home. When's the first time
they lost a game in regulation at home all season? I think it was like the halfway mark.
a game in regulation at home all season.
It looked like, I think it was like the halfway mark.
So those two teams unable to do it,
we got two more teams going to game six,
or excuse me, game five up 3-1 with the ability to close it at home.
But like I said, if I'm a betting man,
but given the stats of teams
that have been able to come back from 3-1 deficits,
Bonus doesn't want to hear anything.
His post-game conference, he says,
I don't give a fuck about what stat you're going to read me about teams being down 3-1. We still got a dog in the
fight. We'll be ready to go. So maybe Bonus, like he did at the beginning of the season when it
seemed like the wheels were falling off with that organization, leadership in the dressing room
issues, he was able to galvanize the group and then come in the clutch and make playoffs. So
we'll see what they got cooking in Game 5.
I did want to talk about Laurent Preissaro on Vegas.
3-1, 275 goals against, 902 save percentage.
This guy's basically been a journeyman.
He was waived earlier in the year.
And he's out playing fucking Connor Hellbuck right now on the verge of moving on to the second round.
Great story.
And also, how about this tattoo parlor out in Vegas?
They're basically giving out free tattoos if they're Vegas-style tattoos.
You know, if you want to show up and get a freebie.
Yeah, it's pretty cool, guys, actually.
So the Vegas Golden Knights are actually, like, paying this company to come sit outside the arena.
You know how, like, right before you walk into T-Mobile Arena, there's kind of that big open area right in front of the arena?
Well, they're just sitting outside tattooing people.
If it's Vegas Golden Knights themed,
they give it to you for free.
I mean, I think that's pretty cool.
Hey, we got our Vegas insider, Migs, out there for game notes.
We might have to send him over there to get a tattoo for us.
See how it works.
He could get one right on his head.
Do they do devil's mascot tattoos?
I might have to fly out there and get a free one
the way that the devils are playing right now.
Holy cow.
Holy cow. Wow. Pasha might end up owning some people on here and on the internet i'm scared i am nervous this
is not good i'm i'm doing all i can do well it's it's actually today now but i'm doing drastic
measures today i'll be going down to mika's burger Shop, get his hamburger. Last year when I ate one, I turned around their 3-1 series deficit,
and I ended up winning in seven games.
So I'm going to get him going because he's been invisible all playoffs.
What's going on there?
I don't know.
Maybe they'll tell me if I go down there.
They'll give me the inside scoop.
I don't know.
I said on Game Notes Daily, like, zero adjustments from the Rangers.
I remember 2011 Stanley Cup final
right like the Bruins were completely worked over embarrassed in Vancouver and they come home and
it's the exact opposite I know that it was opposite in the fact that the Rangers were on the road
I don't know if I've ever seen like a series switch like it has it's been what the hell happened either I think it's probably a
little of both the Devils started playing their game uh we talked about the huge press conference
about just saying we got whacked they knew they got whacked they weren't ready to go in either
game and they changed up everything defensively well the biggest thing they changed up was putting
in Schmid and he's been sick monster guy Pasha talked about how
apparently he's just I think his dad was a um a kung fu master or something like that I think that
he's very cool calm and collected and that's what they talk about so that was the biggest difference
and then with him they obviously just figured out the defensive zone and the neutral zone they just
clogged it up that's what they do do. They're good five on five.
And Jack Hughes looks phenomenal.
And the Rangers, they stopped skating.
Merles, we were texting during the game.
They couldn't even complete a pass.
It was embarrassing.
Every pass was on the wall, hit a stick, back to the middle.
They looked so out of sync that to be at home and perform like that,
I got to think the Devils are the favorites in that series now.
What's the line in Vegas?
It's still like pretty even money for the series.
The power play all of a sudden disappeared.
It looks terrible.
I would say it's all about adjustments, though,
and you got to give credit to Lindy Ruff and his staff.
The first couple games, they weren't really adjusting to the Crider and net front.
And he was just getting these easy tap
ins i would i mean what's he got four power play goals on the series rangers have gone oh for eight
on the power play oh my god i gotta listen to this fucking jesus christ i will say wow you guys are
playing some great hockey i was just talking about your adjustments on the PK. Rangers 0-8 right now since Schmid's been in.
Five on five, they've been incredible.
And then overall, not really allowing a lot of Rangers to the house.
Doing a better job of protecting the net front.
That's one thing that the Rangers were doing unbelievable,
and I still think they are.
But the last thing you got to say is right now,
Jack Hughes is putting on a consmite type performance.
Like they're not getting an incredible amount of offense.
They've dried up since regular season and what their standard was then.
But it seems like they've really tightened up defensively
and figured things out.
And then Jack's coming through in the clutch.
I was just tipped off by a little birdie that the boys were doing,
their little Devil's Rangers talk.
And I wanted to sit in, supervise, and make sure you were paying them the respect they deserve,
and it definitely sounds like you're doing that, Faze.
Yeah, we are. We're respecting you guys now.
You've earned some respect after those two games in MSG,
but these playoffs, every year, there's always these storylines.
This will be the series where the road team wins every game,
so it's perfect the rangers have
they don't have home ice it's going to be that series talked about all seven games the road team
one chance no chance devils are in the driver's seat now they're not looking back they're going
to take the next two games and uh and i think we both know that they're going to mop whoever is in
the next round looking like carolina and then basically going straight to the tattoo shop. So Frank the Tank was disgusted at the fact that you went to Presidential Center or Prudential
Center, however you pronounce it, and they went 0-2. Are you invited back? Will you be attending
the game with Frank the Tank? Is he nixing you from attending any games? My lifetime record of
playoff games at the Prudential Center is 2-2,
so I don't know what he's talking about.
Okay.
Well, he didn't say it.
I just know that when Witt was texting him or tweeting at him,
he was pretty disgusted at the fact that you'd mushed him.
Listen, I'll just say this.
The Devils look good, and, you know,
I know you guys harp on me for these advanced analytics or whatever,
but it's the same reason I knew that team was going to be good.
It's the same reason I didn't give up faith in them.
In terms of expected five-on-five goals for every team in the playoffs,
the Devils are number one, the Rangers are number 16, dead last.
And like I said, the Devils are going to win this series
because they're a better five-on-five team.
Most of the games played five-on-five.
Devils are winning in six.
Wow.
Nerd.
Nerd.
I mean,
Seagate Dollar, that game winner,
what a shot.
And to have him
be scratched and then everyone
be that confused, pretty cool story.
That's inexcusable. Yeah, it made no sense.
I mean, I would love to hear the reasoning
behind doing that, but looked awesome
in game three and then game four, the game
winner, and Pat Kane, a little bit then game four, the game winner, and Pat
Kane, a little bit of a liability on the game winner, you said?
I mean, you know, just go back and look at the highlight when Nico chucks that sauce
cross ice, Patty Kane just skating circles, looks like a lost little puppy out there.
So, he had his big goal, his big moment in game two.
I haven't noticed him once since.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Any other death threats just the one death threat but then the guy after you called him out by name on on game notes the guy uh apologized changed his name changed his profile photo and then blocked
me so wit i think you scared him a little bit i mean if you're gonna be sending if you if i i get
i get hundreds of hate dms but for the most part mean, they call me scumbag and all that,
but they're not life-threatening.
If you're life-threatening somebody,
you probably deserve to be called out,
and you've got some serious issues you might need to get settled.
Definitely, yeah.
That guy is something wrong.
He probably wears two jerseys to games.
Exactly.
But I'd like to shout out the power of game notes here
because they call out the Rangers for suspending me the next day,
or sorry, for blocking me the next day they unblocked me.
You call out this guy for the death threats, he apologized right away.
So power to game notes.
They make shit happen.
Yeah, we're movers. We're big movers.
Mosh, you were at MSG at least one of those games, correct?
Both games, yeah.
Wasn't the mood deal, wasn't it like a funeral home in there?
I heard it was just like dead. oh they gave up they gave up so quick i mean i
would say with about five minutes left in a second fans are booing they're going what's going on
people are talking about beating the traffic getting home there was no resiliency in that in
that fan base it was pathetic to see that place is a joke i feel like there's the better fans were
over in new jersey with us like because it was half Rangers, half Devils.
Like the hardworking blue-collar people we were talking about
can afford the Devils.
Say blue-collar one more time.
They can afford the Devils games.
It's all corporate and MSG and nerds wearing the suits and stuff.
These fans at MSG, they cheer louder for the big-time celebrities
they throw up and the Hollywood actors and the New York Jets players.
That gets more of a roar from the crowd
than the Rangers in a one-goal game trying to fight back.
Are you saying that they're back to being the Fugazis?
They were never not the Fugazis.
They're the worst fans in the league.
Well, there you have it.
So this is a guy who has the upper hand right now.
He looked dead to rights,
and now we're going back to the Peru,
and things have completely switched.
If it's exactly the same way it was in 3-4 back in Game 5,
I'm going to have to just bow down to you and say,
wow, you kept saying, devil's in six.
You've got to lose two if you're going to win in six.
I just can't imagine the Rangers won't have some
sort of pushback Merle's medicine's a Benny at he's done nothing so you got to think he's not
going to disappear the entire series I don't say no I agree so this morning at Rangers practice
they reverted back to having him in the one-timer spot they had Kane kind of in front rotating from
there in the bumper so looks like Gallant has made some adjustments. And so I would expect Zibanejad to be hot and horny,
ripping those one-timers in the park.
That's the inside info I need for tomorrow, Pasha.
That's why you have boots on the ground still in NYC for us.
Boots on the ground, baby.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Better believe I won't miss that game.
Love it.
Pasha's showing up as the Uber Eats delivery guy with the Rangers food.
It's all poisoned.
Going American whiskey again before?
Are you going to change it up?
I don't know.
That might be bad luck going there
having those unbelievable hot spicy chicken fingers.
I might not set foot in there.
It's bad juju.
Love it. I love it.
I keep saying every night I'm going to go to sleep.
I'm not going to watch the games,
but how do I not watch that game five tomorrow night?
Look for Timo Maher to have a big night.
I think he's going to break through.
Yeah, he's been quiet.
Merle, so you've just never gone back to Swedish time?
Yeah, it's insane.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Every night I'm like, this is it.
I'm watching the first period and that's it.
And then what happens is I put the computer on TNT so I can hear the biz and army.
And they wrote me in for the 16 minutes,
and all of a sudden the game starts again.
I'm like, oh, all right, I'll watch the second period.
And I fall forward again at the second intermission,
and then I'm like, well, the kid's getting up in two hours anyway.
I might as well just fight it, and it is not healthy.
I'm living RA hours, I think.
Yeah, if you start hallucinating, call me.
I'll get you through it.
No, that's from something you ate, all right? You guys can see now the sun is up here. If you stay up too long, man, you'll start hallucinating and call me. I'll get you through it. No, that's from something you ate already.
You guys can see now the sun is up here.
If you stay up too long, man, you'll start hallucinating,
regardless of what you took or didn't take.
Let me ask you, we're talking about Schmidt here.
Is it true that sometimes if there's not enough highlights on a pro goalie
that can affect the opposing team,
or is that just sort of a myth about goalies?
That's a tough one to answer.
I mean, maybe.
There is enough pre-scouting.
You talked to Derek Lalonde
with his own goalie in Tampa.
I mean, yeah, I guess
if you have enough video,
you could see weaknesses,
you see tendencies.
So I would buy into that.
I mean, the Schmid story is nuts.
He was in the USHL
two years ago, I think.
Right, Pasha?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just going back
to what I said on Game Notes
about his name.
I went back to fact check that.
So his dad's a big karate guy,
and he named him after a movie called Akira in the 90s.
So that's why he's so zen, so calm, and that ice in his veins.
Yeah.
Remember the game?
It wasn't called Game Notes, but the scouting report
Yosey used to put up in Wilkes-Barre,
and every single time it said the goalie hates traffic in tight
upstairs.
It's like, it's all
the same. Like, yeah, if you get traffic
in front of him, he can't see it. It's going to go in. It doesn't matter
who the goalie is. Wait a minute.
Says this guy loves traffic.
What the hell's going on here?
Boys, thank you for having me on. I just want to see if you were
reading this thing. It's Jordan Bennington
loves traffic,
so he can block her guys in the face.
I don't want to crash your parade.
I just have to come in here and make sure Supervisor,
you're paying the Devils respect, so thank you for doing that,
and we'll see what happens tomorrow night.
4-2 Devils is my prediction.
Thank you, Pashua, Devils expert.
Yeah, game five tonight in Newark.
I'm assuming you're going once again, right?
Oh, he's gone.
Yeah, he's going.
He said he's going.
All right.
We have boots on the ground.
We're trying to get boots on the ground in every city of every series
at some point here for chiclets, you know?
All over the fucking place.
Let's see.
Islanders Carolina next up.
Tuesday and Friday, the Islanders live to see another day.
3-2 win over the Canes.
They got goals from Engvall, Nelson, and Barzal.
Sorokin looked great.
Stopped 34 out of 36 shots. So the Islanders go home. They win game six. They got a chance Engvall, Nelson, and Barzal. Sorokin looked great. Stopped 34 out of 36 shots.
So the Islanders go home.
They win game six.
They got a chance in game seven.
Whit, you think they do it?
They force a game seven here or what?
Are they toast?
I am kind of feeling a game seven in that series now.
I did not think I was.
I've been cold.
I told you.
But I said I thought Carolina was going to end it the other night.
And as we talked about Hyman and and you get one in the face,
and it goes in, you don't care.
You'll do anything to score a playoff goal.
When you're Sebastian Ajo, and not only do you get one in the face,
but then it bounces down, and Brock Nelson has the second nicest midair goal
of the week behind Austin Matthews' tip and just bats it in.
Talk about a double whammy for a guy.
And he ended up scoring later
didn't he i think i was scored to make it free to shows the balls on him and to deal with that but i
was just i that is just adding insult to the injury of a puck in the mouth losing teeth and
then you're laying there and the guy's celebrating right your grill so the islanders showed up i mean
that was islanders style.
They're all about, if they get out to the lead,
it's like, I think they're going to win.
If they go down, they're fucked.
They have no offense.
But if they could get the lead
and then Sorokin starts feeling it,
if game six, they get out one, nothing,
I would say that it's over.
And we've seen a game seven.
They got to be thrilled with where they're at.
Going home, game six.
You know they're going to lead off with the identity line.
Sorokin's back to normal.
You'd hope after that junk goal that Horvat scored,
he hadn't had a goal or actually a point in the first 11 periods of the series,
that he gets that junk goal in the third in game four.
Last game assist drives a net on that Barzell goal i don't know if you
guys ended up seeing the the replay on that where barzell being the giver that he is looking to pass
the entire time the defenseman could have been more obvious about taking the way away the pass
probably knowing what barzell's uh going to do but he ends up ripping it home and scores a goal
well as he's fucking going to celebrate with Horvat,
he's apologizing him for not sliding it over.
He's like, I was looking for you.
I was looking for you.
It's like, Jesus Christ, dude.
It's okay to have that killer instinct once in a while
and look at it panned out for you.
Ends up being a huge big-time goal.
So, given the injuries to Carolina,
I look at both forward groups
and I just,
I like the Islanders better up front.
I know systems aside in the way that,
that Carolina plays as a five man unit,
but man,
they got Islanders have some game breakers.
Like you saw Nelson,
what he did off that play off of all his face.
They got other guys in that lineup who can fucking make some plays.
And I don't know,
man,
I got a,
I got a nervous feeling for Carolina right now
because they got a few, you know,
they got some young guys in the lineup
and maybe a little bit of inexperience
going into a very hostile environment.
That'll be the drunkest,
that'll be the drunkest one-mile radius
on the planet come game six.
Yeah, and you got to remember,
yeah, Ranta was 0-8 or something on the road
in the playoffs before that last win.
So he is no good on the road.
We've talked about their injuries.
They're depleted up front as the games go on.
The guys are playing more minutes than they're used to.
They're getting more tired and more tired.
All this is in the Islanders' favor.
I see the shirt you have on there, Witt.
That place is bonkers for the games.
Oh, yeah, Burrellis.
And they got Frankie and Stu behind them.
I love them in game six.
Yeah, Burrells, having all first period,
I just cashed in the series so far.
Yeah, I think I saw a stat on that,
but I'll tell you another stat I saw,
and I knew as soon as I saw it I shouldn't have done it,
was the Bruins hadn't given up a goal in the first period,
and look what happened tonight.
So whenever you see these stats,
you got to go the opposite sometimes.
I swear on those little first period stats,
they show them to you to try to make you take them.
Don't fall for those ones.
How about this one,
and given the run that the Islanders have been on in playoffs,
like they went to the Eastern Conference Finals,
that game the other night was the first time
they went into the first intermission with a lead
in 24 playoff games.
That was sick. I saw that. That's insane. The first time they've gone into the first intermission with a lead in 24 playoff games that was sick i saw that that's insane they've gone into the first intermission with a lead in 24 playoff
games and look at the success they've had so talk about zombies these guys don't die the islanders
don't go away and if in in fact i would probably say they got car Carolina right where they want them. But if you go up like two or three on them, you got them, I feel.
Yeah.
And in game five, Mayfield had the tough go of it.
Was it game one or two, the OT winner?
Yeah, tough turnover.
Yeah.
Well, remember he got high-sticked.
It didn't get called.
Oh, yeah.
So, you know, it's like tough go.
Well, then Nosen scored. Stefan Nason, excuse me. it didn't get called oh yeah so you know it's like tough go well then no no since scored
stefan nason excuse me and they called it back because they went back and saw it was off sides
and it was kind of his fault it wasn't his fault they were on the pk but it ends up being like the
puck goes right by him well later on in the third period they had a they had a penalty they were up
three two and he ate about 35 seconds just pinning it
against the against the the wall he kind of killed the penalty like himself almost and that was just
enormous for him and Engvall too Merlez I asked you about Engvall and I was reading all this about
like Islanders recaps and you said right away no no he's great for them. He's fast, he's big, he's strong.
He was a beast in Game 5 as well.
I mean, kind of like fits their pattern.
Like, struggles offensively at times,
maybe not the most creative, but has the speed.
He's all over the puck.
And so to have guys like that stepping it up,
that's why there is a Game 6.
Bistron Amos has a prediction.
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Everyone listen. Sprinkle, sprinkle a little bit.
Just a tad. Not the whole bankroll. Not a unit, not a half a prediction. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Everyone listen. Sprinkle a little bit. Just a tad. Not the whole bankroll. Not
a unit. Not a half a unit. Just a little bit
on first goal score
in game six.
Bo Horvat. I feel like
the juju's coming. Two straight games with
a point. He's been getting dogged on
left and right. Everybody's saying that fucking
offense has dried up like a nun's cunt.
They got him on eight times eight. Everybody's
freaking out. I think he's going to revive
his offense, and I think he's going to score the opening
goal in game six and get that building
rock, and he's going to have the Jets
offensive line with their new quarterback, I'm
sure. You know Rodgers is going to show up
and just drop a bomb on the place,
chugging beers on the Jumbotron.
I got the Islanders in 6-2.
Horvat to score the opener.
Their power play has been brutal.
6.7 has been their power play.
That's probably why they haven't been scoring at all.
Do you think is the power play, is that just a personnel issue
or is it a coaching issue, a little bit of both?
Why does their power play suck so bad?
Because they rely so much on Barzell.
Yeah, it's just like one guy.
I mean, Horvat is a great
net front guy and stuff but it hasn't
really been what they hoped it would be
when he came over and if you
don't have that stud
every good team it's four forwards
and a defenseman and
most of these elite power plays
if they don't have a McDavid right?
You need like a stud defenseman up top
moving it around. I mean you need somebody like and Polak has a great shot but I don't have a McDavid, right, you need like a stud defenseman up top, moving it around.
I mean, you need somebody like  and Pollock has a great shot,
but I don't know how great  what?
No, I said, yeah, he's got a good  But I don't picture him as like a power play QB.
So you see a lot of Islanders fans barking right now
because Noah Dobson had a great offensive year last year.
I think he really struggled this year in his sophomore campaign
where I see a lot of fans barking online about actually putting Polak
on that first unit and just really simplifying things
and then taking Dobson off as that one defenseman.
My biggest advice, RA, especially for a meat and potatoes type team
like the Islanders, is when you just get the power play,
treat it as if it's five on five just simplify don't don't worry about finding these seam passes and making the fancy play because oftentimes when you just simplify things and then you just start
directing things towards the net what happens is the house is going to close up and then you're
going to have plenty of time to work it around and find your shots and get your lanes. So that's just my opinion where they need to treat it more like five-on-five.
Fuck off with just allowing Barzell to take it in.
Dump it in. Go fucking get it.
Because the zone entries haven't been working in their favor either.
And you saw that in, I believe it was game three,
when Barzell tried a zone entry like they always do.
Everybody's just standing at the blue line watching him.
Well, it ends up getting turned over. Brock Nelson gets caught flat-footed, and then they go back the
other way, two-on-one score shorthanded. So if I'm the Islanders, five-on-five mentality when you're
up a man and just get the job done. If you don't score, just generate momentum. Don't kill your
momentum. That's the biggest thing right there i know the percentage is low just worry about
generating momentum yeah i would get out of the one three one everybody's doing the one three one
now islanders it obviously doesn't work for you guys go back to like a two three two guys up top
get three guys around the net and just pound pucks at the net and get some ugly ones because
barzell's in a flank position and he's not a threat with his shot so everybody
it's easier for them to read what's going to happen because they're more concerned about the
pass lanes than respecting what he's going to do with his shot so to me i don't know fucking maybe
they change it up and they make horvat the one of the flank guys and then make barzell the bumper
i don't know they gotta do. Not enough adjustments have been made.
I think the only power play goal they've gotten was the Palmieri one that ended up being a big one in game three.
And what did they do?
All they did was fucking find a lane, fire it to the net,
and then he tipped it in.
Meat and potatoes hockey.
Islanders.
The zombies.
They ain't dead yet.

Merles, I want to ask you, Anthony, he's been pretty good some games,
not so good in other games.
Freddie Anderson hasn't been dressing.
Do you think there's any chance we see, I would say, Peter Konchetkov,
who had some pretty good games for them this year?
Do you think if they get desperate?
No, I know you love the goalie changes, but they're still up in the series.
If you change the goalie now, it just puts panic in the whole organization.
You're up 3-2.
You've got to think you're in control.
You've got to show you're in control.
You do a panic goalie change like that, you're done.
I'm actually shocked that Ronta's been able to stay healthy
because usually you see every time within a series, he ends up pulling a groin or getting bumped into and he's out with a with a head injury
and I'm not ragging on the guy I don't think I've ever seen a goalie go to the IR more than him and
I fucking and the Leafs got Matt Murray and I'm saying that so overall though he's been kicking
he has not been the issue I'd keep him in too I don't know if you guys have been watching these
streams that have been going on at Borelli's.
Just incredible stuff there.
Just psychotic fans.
But some of the funniest clips right now on the internet
are Stu Feiner and how much food he is consuming
at Borelli's during this game
and him stealing Frankie's ice cream yesterday on the stream.
It's some of the funniest content I've ever seen.
So if you haven't seen those videos yet, we're posting them on Chicklets.
Viva La Stool posts them. Go
check them out because they're unbelievable. I think the streams
are on Barstool Sports YouTube as
well. So check them out there. Stu, he is
a fucking absolute character for sure.
Maniac. Next up, Minnesota
Dallas. Dallas, they're one
win away from moving on to the second round after
a thorough 4-0 whitewashing
of Minnesota. Give them a 3-2 series
lead. Sagan, Robinson,
Marchmont, and Delandria were the goal scorers in that
game. Stars power play is third
in the league, 40.9. That's
pretty good shit. They were only 24 during
the year. Let me ask you,
what's Pete DeBoer doing
that Bones couldn't or wouldn't do last
year, do you think? I think he has
Jake... I mean, they had Jake Ottinger last year.
This guy is  it's insane.
He right now is dominating the series.
And, I mean, more referee drama, right?
And, Fiz, you guys did an unreal job.
I think it was you, Anson Carter, and the old
who's the old referee that works with you guys?
Well, Brad Meyer, and then we had Hank there as well.
We're actually going to roll the clip of the full breakdown of us talking about it,
and then we can come out of it.
So I hope you guys enjoy the breakdown.
It might be a little bit harder to understand because we were explaining it when you could see it on TV.
So we're going to get into it afterward more in depth if you don't understand this clip.
Players' perspective on what you saw from Marcus Feligno and that hit on Radek Fox.
I think it's very unfortunate for both sides.
I think that it sucks for Marcus Foligno because he was clearly going to make a shoulder-shoulder
hit.
You have to be in control of your body.
But this is more for Dallas fans to understand that this was not a dirty, malicious play.
And we'll end up getting to your call on it.
But let's roll the tape to get everybody a little bit more of a breakdown.
This puck ends up going in the air.
And as a player, you can't close your hand on the puck.
So when Faxa gets it, it ends up going to his backhand side.
And you can see that Foligno's planted, right?
So as Faxa comes down to the ice,
it looks like it's going to be a shoulder-to-shoulder hit
because he's square.
But because it ends up on his backhand side,
the way that your top hand has to go and bottom hand, he ends up rotating.
So it opens up his top part of his body,
where the only part that ends up making contact is leg-on-leg.
Now, I get it.
As a Dallas fan, you're thinking, this is dirty.
This is knee-on-knee.
But me and Ace are going to go through it right now to show you more so in slow-mo
as to how this actually works okay so as faxa comes up and grabs this puck keep in mind he can't
close his hand on it because that's a two minute minor it ends up quickly going to his backhand
side so as it goes there and as it goes to his backhand side he has to rotate to adjust to the
puck so all of a sudden this when it was square coming in, he ends up going like this.
So now he's got nothing to hit as far as the upper body, and that exposes his leg.
Now, once again, it's just an unfortunate situation, Ace, and I'll hand it over to you.
But as a player, Foligno, you have to be in control of your own body.
But I don't think this was malicious at all.
I still question on whether it should have been a two or a five. But anything that you want to chime in with? I don't think this was malicious at all. I still question on whether it should have been a two or a five,
but anything that you want to chime in with?
I don't think it's malicious at all either.
I think Marcus Foligno went in, and he's already committed to the hit.
Like, when I'm watching him, he's thigh on thigh with Fox.
If he extends his knee or extends his leg, then I think it's going to be an issue.
I think it's an issue.
Is that your phone?
But when I see Foligno going in and he makes that contact,
he could have easily, if he's trying to hit knee on knee,
he could have easily hurt himself as much as hurting Fox.
So I don't think Foligno went in there to try to take his knee out.
And Fox, if he stays square,
I don't think he takes the brunt of that impact on his leg
because I think his shoulder would have taken it.
It would have been square.
Malicious or not, you're looking at this,
and they reviewed it because it was a five-minute, and they decided to give the five-minute
and the game.
You agree with that?
I do, 100.
And Biz made a good point.
The very first statement where the initial contact is leg-on-leg,
and that's the key.
If in the play he goes in to make the hit,
and there is a little bit of shoulder, and then there's knee-on-knee contact,
you have a little more latitude. But because the initial contact is leg on leg or knee
on knee it's thigh whatever um and he basically that's the first contact and he flips him over
and down he goes do you take into consideration the fact that the legs stay straight versus he's
leaning into it would you take when it comes to potential suspension, would you look at that?
Yeah, sometimes they're very obvious where they stick the leg out, right,
and then make contact.
This one here, it's just an unfortunate hockey play.
I agree.
I don't think it was malicious at all, but the unfortunate part of it is
that initial contact is leg on leg.
Does the ref, when watching that tape, take into consideration the fact that when he grabs that puck
and it goes to his backhand, in order for Foxa to make the play on the puck,
he has to rotate his upper body.
Therefore, Foligno, he can't make contact with his shoulder and or chest
because he completely rotates like that or there's really nothing for him to hit here.
That space all of a sudden is non-existent.
Yeah, but that's not Fax's fault either, right?
The onus is still on the guy making the hit.
And again, I don't think it's malicious, but the unfortunate part is.
And you don't have to extend your leg out.
But that's also why I say, well, yes, he still obviously would get a two-minute penalty
as opposed to five-minute where that's malicious.
That's where I'm saying is why wouldn't it just be a two then if they're taking that into consideration the five isn't because it's malicious the five is because of the degree of the impact
the degree of the force involved in the play and when a five minute penalty is assessed automatic
game misconduct the only one more severe is a match penalty where maybe there's a fight situation
or something where a guy needs a guy when he's down, and that would be on the extremes.
Yeah, so before I go to you, I was very surprised that it ends up being a major.
And Merles gave me the quote that I thought was perfect.
It was Dean Evanson.
He said, two guys were going at each other, and one guy decided to move.
And there was no sticking out of the knee.
And I know the breakdown did a good job,
but give me your opinion on that standing as a major.
Oh, for me, like I said, it was Foxa who moved.
And if you take that into consideration,
the hardest problem, though, for officials
is not only are they reviewing it,
but I think there's a subconscious element
when the other guy goes down the tunnel who got hurt,
where he's the victim of the hit,
they probably have to assume this guy's not coming back.
So to only give him two and allow Foligno to stay in the game,
if in fact it ends up being like an injury that lasts longer
than not only just that game, but further,
then you're like, God, like we saw the hit,
the guy ends up injured from the play,
and then the onus has to be on like we saw the hit the guy ends up injured from the play and then the
onus has to be on the guy throwing the hit but as I said in the breakdown he has his feet planted
and he's ready for the hit and that guy comes down after jumping Foxa from grabbing the puck
and when he gets down his first like when you freeze the tape after the puck starts coming
down towards his backhand they are both square to
each other so all of a sudden but because that puck and it was his own fault he grabbed it and
put it to his backhand he completely rotates his body so therefore there's nowhere in the chest or
shoulder for felino to hit him so yeah it ends up going leg on leg it looked really nasty and i can
understand giving him the two minute minor because the onus is on the player but there was no a malicious intent he was squared up and as
dean evanson said it's like the the other player moved if you're trying to dodge a hit and you end
up getting injured from it the owner should be on the player trying to avoid the hit in my opinion
so i know dallas fans were happy about it because they feel like,
well, at least at the beginning of the series they were getting hosed.
But I tell you what, man, games four and five,
have you ever seen a player be on the wrong side of three calls
in your entire life the way that Foligno has?
I mean, did we roll the audio of Foligno describing those to media members,
the two calls that he got hosed off?
Yeah, I think that was last episode.
Okay, so I didn't know if we ended up rolling the clip,
but he was like, it was fucking bullshit.
It's fucking bullshit.
And I do believe he's been hosed the most out of anyone.
And then they go down on that five-man power play,
and who's the guy who's been stepping up for the Dallas Stars
now that Pavelski's not in the lineup?
Tyler, say again.
He's been all over the net front, and we ended up having him on.
And I think we should actually go to this too
because we were able to interview him after the game.
And Anson Carter talked about how he's been able to replace Pavelski.
And if there's anything Pavelski has given as far as advice
in order to have this type of success come playoff time.
Seg's great game tonight.
I had to double check and make sure in some of your goals
that you're wearing number 91 and not number 16.
Joe Pavelski not being in the lineup.
You're doing a great Pavelski impersonation.
Are you talking to Joe off the ice a little bit,
or have you been watching him all season long
to see what he's been doing in front of the net?
I've been watching him since he touched down in Dallas a couple years ago.
Doing whatever I can to keep the seat warm
and not mess up that power play unit.
So coming out of that, Tyler Sagan currently has four playoff goals right now.
He had four playoff goals in his previous 33 playoff games.
And this is a guy who was playing banged up over the course of the last couple seasons, but
really elevating his play at the right time
even after all this criticism
in the last couple years about him and Jamie
Ben making all this money and not being able
to produce to the standards in which
they did. So it's
impressive to see in Dallas
they're making Minnesota pay
and I mean, I guess we
could probably hand it off to the leading point getter
in all of playoffs, Rupe Hintz, and what he's doing as that first line center.
He's unreal.
He's so fast.
And Dallas now, the word is Pavelski's going to play game six or may.
No shit.
Yeah, so he may play.
So I guess it's not the word that he's playing,
but it seems that everything's going their way.
Minnesota's PK is horrific.
Horrific.
Dallas has two or more power play goals every game
except for the game three.
So if you can't stop,
not only are they getting screwed on the calls,
then they can't even bail themselves out.
So as everything's looking on the up and up for Dallas with their goalie and and how good they've looked and that's
a big just shutout win at home I mean they went to Minnesota after game two where they had a great
game and I mean they went and they were horrible they got work so I don't think this series is over
yet I do not at all I think that this goes seven. If they have any chance of
coming back in this series, they got to see the caprice off they did in the regular season. He
just hasn't been as dominant. You see these shifts sometimes where he's got those 10 and 2 hips
murals where he's buzzing around the offensive zone where I would say that any regular season
game you watch, there's probably four shifts where he just completely takes over. And I would have to imagine that he's still a little bit injured.
He missed 13 games at the end of the regular season and came back just in time for playoffs.
And he just hasn't been able to get that time and space.
And you go back to game one when Suter was all over him, giving him those nasty cross
checks.
You wonder if maybe that has discouraged him a little bit where the less time and space come
playoff time, it's just a harder time
to perform. And
Billy G has also said it multiple
times and a lot during this regular season.
He's a Russian player.
He's a superstar. He's going to get that
nasty attention from defenders.
He doesn't get the calls like the North American
guys do. He doesn't.
And that's a fact. You can see clip over clip.
Even go back to that game one when Suter fucking buries him two times
and he doesn't end up going to the box as a result of it.
And the other guy also, Merle, as I'm looking at is Boldy.
He did so much for this team to get into playoffs by catching on fire
with the absence of Kaprizov.
It's just sometimes these young guys, man,
like you're not used to playing
that full 82 and then having to ramp it up for playoffs on top of that where you're playing
night in and night out and the body's maybe just not developed at that at that state yeah you got
to learn how to how to raise it up but I want to go into I know RA is going to love this but I got
to talk about Otter I love him he looks so great But what do you do with the goaltending in Minnesota?
Do you throw flower in to try to get some magic?
No, you go back to Gus.
All right.
The two power play goals in the first period.
And another thing too, Merle,
is how many power plays did many have in that second period?
They had three power plays and they weren't able to execute.
I get it.
Sometimes, and you could speak able to execute. I get it. Sometimes,
and you could speak more to this, right? Is when you're a guy who's playing 20, 22 minutes as a defenseman, and more specifically your special teams is power play, not penalty kill. If you're
shorthanded for seven minutes of the first period, it takes some of the guys out of the game. You're
sitting there the whole time and you're on the kill where you're not getting your touches. So all of a sudden, the whole first period,
it seems like their top end guys are taken out of it because they're in the box. And then the
second period comes and then finally they get their opportunities where they're just sleeping
on the power play. They go 0 for 3 and then that was their opportunity to come back into the game
being down 2-0. Kaprizov having one point in five games,
the fact that they're still alive shows that it's kind of shocking, at least to me.
If you told me that through five games he'd have one goal and not one assist,
I'd say, oh, well, yeah, they lost in four or five.
So he's definitely injured, though.
And you respect guys that are out there grinding
it but he's probably he's probably out there at 70 right now and then when you don't have that
that that quick burst that fast twitch that you just can't you can't get your body to to do it
when you battle in this injury and you're in pain it's just impossible to deal with so um a bunch of
different factors to to to see why dallas is in the lead but minnesota's
given it their all that's why i'm just i'm not i'm not overly confident that dallas closes it
out on the road because that team has heart so i would say that probably the first three games of
the series i would have leaned to minnesota dominating play and and probably as a result
to being ultra physical the only thing I'm nervous about for Minnesota
is with the way they've been punished on these power plays.
And I can't even call it undisciplinedness
because I feel like they've been hosed on a lot of them.
Sometimes what happens is maybe you back off from your game
because you're hesitant because you don't want to put your team
on the penalty kill because it's been leaking oil.
So if they have any chance of coming back in this series they have to get back to that physical play where all guys are involved and getting on that
four check banging bodies for dallas and putting them on the ropes and then getting more traffic
around ottinger that's the only chance they have winning at home in game six and you brought up
you brought up bunting hurt cernak like i remember in the playoffs, guys, you guys will know,
it's like maybe you take a run at Ottinger, right?
Like, not run.
Yeah, blow a wheel, slide in there.
That clip's going to get more engagement than your fine jersey.
You're going to say it is.
Are you trying to say that you've never
like, all right, taking a run at him wasn't the right word.
No, like in front of the net, a guy in front of the net guy's jabbing you.
You just fall down on the goalie, like on purpose.
This is making me sound like he's never heard this before.
No, no, I'm going to say, I just thought it was funny.
The only chance they have coming back of this series is going Corey Perry
accidentally on purpose, giving him the people's elbow on an Ottinger knee.
That's it.
Ottinger, he's unbeatable right now.
You got to do something.
Hey, who would you pick as Minnesota's kamikaze?
Revo.
Well, Toledo might as well just do it.
He's going to get tossed anyway.
Yeah, he's going to do it for free.
You don't even got to give him the shoulder tap.
Hey, imagine you see Revo like that.
Remember that kid from college a couple years ago after the game?
Everybody had left the ice, and the net was on the moorings,
and he just sprinted from center ice and went crashing and pushed the net over.
I don't know why the kid was tweaking,
but what if Revo just starting face-off just to plays in his end,
he just beelines to the other end just buries
Ottinger oh yeah we should probably get away from this or we're going to be having some death threats
of our own so I called out Ottinger the other night I was saying under two and a half goals
for the wild I said I should maybe sprinkle on the shutout obviously I didn't do it because I'm a
loser and uh he got the shutout he looked amazing the night before that's why i did it and he looked
even better last night and i i'm thinking i was talking today about it maybe taking him for a
con smith as a dark horse ra style 30 to 1 wow yeah i don't think there's anything dark about it
and to reiterate uh what said i don't think he's got shai the capris off what i think he's
definitely hurt man because fucking Suter was
cracking him pretty good and then there's the whole like
idea that like Billy Guerin was the one who called
Suter up and told him the fuck and he was done with Minnesota
and you wonder if that like had even
factors in I mean guys do that type
of shit no like oh Ryan Suter
is playing that series with a serious
chip on his shoulder like
every time he touches the puck in Minnesota
yeah he's he's
public enemy number one after the cross checks yeah but even before then like fans wanted him
gone they bought him out it's a proud guy who's played a long time like yeah he's looking to
he's looking to like show them that they made the wrong decision when when in reality they didn't
it made a lot of sense billy garren went over that with us. But, fuck yeah, he's pissed off.
Well, then the other part is, too, Marc-Andre Fleury,
everything they did to bring him in.
I mean, he's got, I think, one start.
His goals against is over seven.
It's been a rough ride for him.
I mean, you know, we obviously like Billy here,
but, you know, there's probably some room for criticism there
considering how Marc-Andre's turned out.
Yeah, 0-1, goals against, 7.00.
Gustafson's playing.
7-7-1. Goals against 7.00. Gustafson's playing. 774.
I know.
Fleury's played one game,
and they were switching off back and forth
at the end of the season
when they went on that magical run.
So he played extremely well leading up to playoffs
to where eventually they obviously gave Gus the nod.
I actually think in game two,
they knew that Dallas was going to come out guns a-bla blazing and Fleury just happened to be the sacrificial lamb where they're maybe in some cases considering
trying to save Gus's confidence because they knew that the storm was about to come.
And sure enough, that's how it went.
You can argue whether that Gus should have started game two, which I would have went
back to Gus.
But overall, you can't also look past like the experience and
and what Fleury probably rubbed off on Gus this is a young goalie in the NHL you need an experienced
partner uh in order to show you the you know what you need to do to be a true professional
how or you know you need a buddy to lean on who like let let's say you're Gus, right, and you're going through a three-game stretch where you're really fighting it.
To have a wily veteran netminder who's literally,
Flory has seen every single situation you could see as a goaltender.
He backed up Matt Murray to two cups.
Like he's done this better than anyone.
He's won one as a starter.
He's won it as a backup.
So he's that calming voice where he can lean on where
yeah in most cases all these teams have goalie coaches but just to have a guy who you know who's
been through been through it too and even so much so when we interviewed him the one time he talked
about how he's also a prankster and that has rubbed off from from flurry as well so one thing
that flurry hasn't adapted was the eating the pepperettes to avoid cramps that Gus does.
And I'd imagine maybe the reason guys aren't going to the crease is because he's dropping fart bombs during the game from the pepperettes.
And you're going to have some in case somebody goes near his crease now.
Yeah, you're going to be pooping his pants all over.
Diarrhea in his crease.
But that's pretty much all I had to say.
And then, I mean, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention Haskin and just...
Yeah, he's great.
He is all ends of the ice, how he drives their team and their offense.
Right?
I know that Carlson's going to win.
Carlson's probably going to win the Norris,
but he should definitely be a finalist and a strong consideration.
I mean, he actually plays defense too.
That's the thing.
He's almost like a poor man's Kael McCarr, a finalist and a strong consideration. I mean, he actually plays defense too. That's the thing.
He's almost like a poor man's Kale McCarr, the way he's able to
gap up on you and take away your
time and space from a defensive aspect,
but yet have that motor offensively
where he could be a one-man breakout,
he can juke guys, and he's a
horse where he's playing 25 minutes most
nights, which we all know is
iron lungs in the NHL.
And for Dallas, it's starting to look like
they might have an easier ride to that Western Conference final
if you're paying attention to the game right now.
But it just makes me take another L.
I mean, Seattle, holy shit, guys.
It's 3-1 right now with six minutes left in the third period.
They're about to
take a 3-2 series lead going home i think a big factor to this is the bounce they got in game four
because not only did they win for one game four at home that hit that kill mccarr ends up putting
on mccann to put him out uh only 40 goal score for the seattle crack in this season but because i'm
imagining because he wasn't thrown out in that game, he's punished
with game five. So currently the Colorado Avalanche are down 3-1 to Seattle in game five in the third
period, and Colorado's at home playing out without their best defenseman. We just talked about
Haskin and what he brings. If you take a defenseman out who helps drive your offense to the rate that
Kael McCarr does, You're talking about forwards who
are used to just blowing the zone as opposed to staying on the wall to be an outlet because
when Cale McCarr has it, he's able to just walk it out of the fucking zone most of the times.
So this throws off your entire team when a guy of his magnitude is taken out. And we talked about
that the big component as to why they had that playoff push towards the end of the season was the big three, Rottenen, McKinnon, and McCarr.
And you take one of those out going against a Seattle team that's as deep as they are,
good luck.
I know, but they didn't have McCarr.
At the end of the year, they were 17-2-3 without him this year.
So 100, you're not replacing him at all.
But Seattle, they just don't stop coming at
you in waves and and I wish I mentioned uh Eberle earlier because like he went through a lot of
shit in Edmonton as well all those years he was there before he was finally traded he got to
experience the playoffs of the Islanders where he's always great for them in big games and now
he's showing up tonight well what's happened this game though, we got, we got a little referee drama
and McKinnon lost his mind. McKinnon put on one of those sick tight turn moves. I haven't seen
the replay, but he gets taken down and no call. He looks at the ref, he's screaming at him,
slashing the glass with his stick.
Well, at the same time, Seattle's flying up the ice.
Eberle, unreal move, goes around the net and finds a tie.
I don't even, it's his first goal of the year.
I don't even know if he played up at all. Yaki or something.
Oh, wait, real quick.
His name is pronounced Cartier.
I looked, I just looked him up.
He played all year in Coachella.
He wasn't drafted.
Scored a huge goal in this game,
but, Biz, when you see the replay,
McKinnon, he lost it.
But it's hard.
You got to get back in the play.
He ends up changing,
so I don't think it led to the goal,
but you see he's furious.
He thinks they missed the call,
and Seattle, they're now going home
with the chance to win this thing?
Oh, my God.
With that crowd.
Holy shit.
I heard it's amazing up there.
The roof will pop off.
Second best home crowd right now, in my opinion, next to Edmonton.
Haxtall was asked about it after the game, about the McCann situation,
and he's like, we've been doing it all year.
Next man up.
You say they throw this guy in the lineup, and now he makes an instant impact.
It's bonkers we actually ended up interviewing jordan eberly after that game at tnt and he had some pretty cool comments
just about the team in general and what's made them successful and some of the guys they've added
in order to bolster that depth on their team so why don't we throw it over that ebbs it's biz here
i feel like you guys don't get enough respect and when talking to Colby Armstrong earlier in the year, you said that this is the deepest team you've ever been on.
How does it feel to have a team where every guy's pulling the rope and contributing night in and night out?
Yeah, that's what we rely on all year is our depth. I think from forward one to forward 12 and all six. We just contribute. We work hard.
We stick to our structure, and we play fast.
And that's kind of been our identity all year.
You've got guys chipping on each night,
and that's why we've found success this year.
Ebbs, just a big game player.
Canadians, tell me if I'm wrong.
I think maybe the best player in the history
of the Canadian World Junior Team?
Maybe not, but up there.
Maybe most clutch?
Most clutch.
Okay, we'll go with that.
I know Bedard's points and everything, but back to the hit.
I don't really understand how it's called the major so they can review it.
We've been over that.
Love the rule.
It gets rescinded to a two, and then you get suspended.
Yeah, because the official on the ice just made the wrong call.
I get McCarr still throwing the hit.
McCarr is not a malicious player.
He doesn't have that in him.
He does play with an edge, and I would imagine that runs down from McKinnon
where most guys kind of play with that bite.
But in which the play goes is McCann's on the right side of the ice.
So as he shoots it, McCarr follows him up
because he assumes that the rebound is going to end up on the backside,
below the goal line, the backside of the net,
where it's in the corner and end up where he ended up hitting him
and assumed the puck was going to drop, and he doesn't hear the whistle.
So sometimes as a player, when that time passes
from when he originally took the shot
which was in the slot and now he's in the corner and he hasn't touched the puck he eases off he
lets up he's not he's not flexing anymore and he's not in his squat position and not bracing himself
to take impact so Makar probably freaking out not hearing the whistle and assuming that that
rebound is going to finally drop above their heads right around where they are battling in the corner he throws that hit and with him not bracing himself
sometimes when you get hit in the shoulder against the glass your upper body sticks
so then it makes your legs swing out from underneath you where you go lateral and when
he went lateral when he comes down he lands on his shoulder and head i don't think they've diagnosed
or said what he's he's out with right now.
My assumption would be a concussion the way that he landed
and or maybe an AC separation.
But no doubt in my mind that McCarr, even though not malicious,
deserved to serve the game.
That's why I said the problem with Colorado was they probably,
now knowing that they lost game four,
would have wished they would have lost them in that game
and then had them playing in this one here.
Oh, 3-2.
3-2. They're marching back.
They've been before. Four minutes
left. They just get one. They got three and a half minutes
to get the tying goal. Now, of course, this is going to
go to OT. All right. All right.
We're just going to miss the walk to school.
Late game always goes OT.
Hey, that kid looked like McCarr that was in the crowd there.
Yeah, McCarr is the huge loss.
You know he was trying to hit McCann.
McCann's one of their top players.
He didn't mean to hurt him that much, but like you said, he wasn't tensed up.
He seems like a light kid.
He doesn't seem like he weighs too much, McCann.
And McCarr, he's a beast.
Yeah, he's a machine.
So unfortunate, but I think it's fair.
I don't have much else to talk about the Seattle Kraken
other than that social justice warrior Buies
about to win his first round playoff series
for the first time in franchise history.
And he looks like he's going to fucking loot a target.
I feel bad saying it, but I'd much rather Dallas or Minnesota play Colorado.
I guess I got to start showing Seattle respect.
They are fun to watch because they're fast,
but I just don't want the Avs out yet.
Well, it's too bad because Nakushin's gone too.
You forget about him gone and the car gone.
Does anyone know the story?
Apparently, middle of the night, he packed up and went back to Russia.
I've heard some couple other rumors.
I don't know if anything's really official.
I don't want to be a rumor boy with that kind of stuff.
We're the rumor boys.
But when it comes to the personal life stuff,
we usually just leave that stuff alone, guys,
and that's just how we operate because we can understand the stresses of real life
and we don't want to get speculating about tough situations.
Yeah, this is just an update.
There's not really speculation.
From Peter Bois, the great beat writer at The Athletic from Colorado,
he said no update from Jared Benda on Valerie Dushushkin.
He said the team is still in contact with him,
and it's not a legal situation.
So, you know, not speculation, just passing that along.
Huge loss.
Huge loss.
Yeah, he's great.
They're playing without three of their better players,
Dushushkin, Landeskog, and now Makar.
That's a big part of your core being taken out,
and when you're playing a team with the type of depth
that Seattle's had all season long,
and as you heard Eb say,
you're in an uphill battle now if they don't pull this one out.
Wow, big score.
Just come over the wire.
Seattle, 3-2 winner with an opportunity to knock out the Stanley Cup.
Like a champion avalanche.
I can't believe this, man.
This is a stunner.
Absolutely stunning that it's going to happen.
I mean, did anybody pick them or bet them in all our shit that we put out there?
No one did, right?
No one picked Seattle.
I think I picked Colorado in five.
They've owned me all year.
Seattle.
Dude, I can't wait until we get there for the Winter Classic next year.
Oh, my God.
Just over the wire here.
Jordan Eberle suspended for game six for misgendering Bowie in that interview that we did.
Oh, my God.
You're going to get the death penalty for this.
Holy shit, dude.
Yeah, he referred to him as a he, and he doesn't like to be referred to as, oh, my God, this is just fucking nuts.
too as oh my god this is just fucking nuts that's i mean so that kind of is a is a pendulum swinging moment where you get mccarr coming back and then eberly out that's fucking nuts anyway
i'll give you a quick little stat on that series just came across my twitter
no nhl team has ever defeated the defending stanley cup champ in their first ever playoff series
chris jastrzemski i think that's your tnt guy oh yes yeah jazz is the jazzy what a stat defending Stanley Cup champ in their first ever playoff series. Chris Jasjczynski.
I think that's your TNT guy.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Jas is the best.
Jas, what a stat that is.
Oh, he's the stat man.
Yep.
Holy shit, Seattle.
Good job.
Okay, let's see.
Justin Braun, congratulations.
He retired after 13 NHL seasons.
I thought you'd be caught a couple weeks ago, boys.
Did you see that Schworts actually let his dad
sit on the bench for his last game?
It's kind of low-key, but someone put it
on Twitter. That's a really cool thing. You ever hear that before?
No. Having a parent on the
bench, I mean, it's different, but I thought
it was a really nice gesture Torts did.
Yeah, it was. I didn't know it was the whole game.
I thought it might have just been the last period, but
either way, I mean, just to have that
experience, I mean, he was very happy after that they got to do that.
All the memories of your dad and mom, for that matter, driving you to the rink and just putting in the time and effort to have you achieve your dreams.
And as it's kind of all ending, the last game, the last period, your dad's with you.
I've never heard of that, and that was a cool gesture.
It was probably the coolest thing that happened in the Flyers organization this year.
Except for when we met Hazy for beers a few months ago.
Yeah.
That might have been it.
Oh, fuck.
Merles, got some hockey coming to Sweden next year.
The Global Series 2023, Global Series is going to be at Stockholm.
They're playing at Avicii Arena.
We got the Wings, Wild, Leafs, and Sens.
What should fans look forward to do?
What's going to be going on over the Emeralds? I love it.
I love it. I've been waiting for this because I think
I can talk you guys all into coming over
here so we can have a big chick. When is it?
It's in the middle of November.
The SHL
will be going on, so we could catch a couple of
SHL games, some Elsvenskins games.
We could have a time wit.
I've done the research there's gonna
probably be no golf we'd have to travel two hours south from stockholm to have find a golf course
open so i don't know if we could get a sandbagger mixed in hey stockholm's close to other european
countries that have golf in november i would love to go over there i remember you a story you went
with zetterberg on a private helicopter to go golf. So, you know, maybe we can do something with him while you're here.
But Sweden will be great.
If there's fans coming over, you're going to love it.
You got to try the kebab pizza.
I have the restaurant with the best Swedish meatballs.
I'll have an entire blog by then for the whole concierge of Stockholm
for all these North Americans that are going to come over.
And I think it's amazing that there's going to be four teams here.
That's classy of you, Merles.
Yeah, I'll take care of everybody. Are they just playing
in Stockholm? Yep. Yeah, they'll all be
at this big, I guess it's called Avicii Arena.
Now, when I played in it, it was called Globe Arena.
It's right next to
Jurgarden and AIK's rink where,
well, you only played two games with, but.
So, yeah, I was thinking maybe we should go
to Australia, but I guess we'll start
it off in Sweden instead.
I mean, the only thing is it seems like they have stuff in Sweden
almost every year or every other year for the World Cup.
Yeah, every other.
I think I feel like every other.
Where Australia would be a great opportunity
because you just never know when it's going back.
It's been years and years since they've done that.
Are those preseason games or are those regular season?
They're preseason?
Yeah, Australia's going to be preseason at Rod Laver Stadium.
Okay, well, fuck you.
So we'll do both.
You want to go both?
Oh, Jesus.
And we go to Australia.
Let's keep going left.
So we'll fly over to Asia instead of coming back the other way.
I think we're Sweden and Australia is the furthest away from
you can be in the planet from each other.
So that'll be a tough flight from Australia up here.
That's why we're training you for this season, Merle,
all these back and forth flights.
Yeah, Stockholm's easy for you guys.
Merle, do you know the most isolated set of islands
on the planet?
Nope.
Hawaii.
Boom.
Good job, Wade.
I was just going to say the last thing on my mind,
Calgary's getting a new rink.
So well-deserved, I'd say.
I guess that's not the right term, but they needed it.
That place, great atmosphere.
I actually love playing there, but I've never been to a game as a fan,
and apparently it's been a while now in terms of like we've got to get something new.
We've got to get a state-of-the-art arena,
and we've got to get with the times a little bit.
So that'll be unreal. I don't know where it's going in the city did they did they say that
already um i don't know it's gonna it's gonna be partially on the stampede grounds not far from
where it is right now and i also asked that brad meyer who was the official who jumped in on that
explanation of the felino hit he said that the the plan is right now is to bulldoze the old saddle
dome oh yeah that land would be split between the stampede grounds and then the city so um interesting
to hear that but yeah i mean for for you think about the calgary economy and how much that the
calgary flames drive it no brainer to finally get to a deal on on uh on figuring out who's going to
pay for the cement for the sidewalks yeah a city of of Calgary, province of Alberta, Calgary Stampede,
and the Calgary Sports and Entertainment Corporation, which, of course, owns the Flames.
They're all in cahoots together.
The Saddle Dome, the second oldest barn in the league after Madison Square Garden.
They've had the Flames since 83.
So, yeah, like we just said, it's a long time coming for a new barn for them,
but it should be exciting once they get it.
I think that pretty much wraps up all the hockey, all the news here, boys.
Playoffs have been a ball so far.
I can't wait until we do this again, what, Sunday night?
Sunday night.
We'll be here Monday morning.
You'll hear from us again.
We got some crazy, crazy games coming up in these next few days.
Let's see.
We got the Leafs storyline.
We got the Oilers.
Can the Islanders mount this miraculous comeback?
It never ends.
Are the Devils, Poshas for real?
Are they the Fugazis?
Or are they the Forrealsies?
We come to find out with the Rangers.
So thanks for listening, and we will be back.
Guys, and real quick before we go,
