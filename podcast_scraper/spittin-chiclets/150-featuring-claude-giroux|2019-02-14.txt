Hey, Spittin' Chicklets listeners, you can find every episode on Apple Podcasts,
Spotify, or YouTube. Prime members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. hello everybody welcome to episode 150 of spit and chiclets presented by new amsterdam vodka
let's say hello to the gentlemen today. Let's go to
Ryan Whitney first. What's going on, Whitdog?
Where are you these days? How are you?
I'm in Secaucus. As you can
tell behind me, I'm still in my hotel room
at the Residence Inn. That is
not a Sub-Zero fridge for anyone wondering.
I'm pumped up to do
this today, boys. I got some hockey
knowledge right now as I'm at the network.
Nice. They're feeding you with stats. Next, let's go to our other host paul bisonette biz nasty where are you
right now buddy you just got off a plane right i'm just gonna simplify my game hello everyone
and uh i got lit up by spitting chiclets memes for my my intro last episode i was going for that jay-z
like it's your boy that was better that was pretty good right there. Okay, see? See? I just...
I thought you were getting one off when you did it the first time.
Can you play the Jay-Z clip where he's like...
It's your boy.
It's your boy.
Last but not least, our producer, Mikey Grinelli.
What's up, brother?
What's up, boys?
Very excited to unleash the voicemail line today,
but more importantly, I'm very excited because I caught another mouse today.
Got him right in the head.
It's like it's a good thing.
Oh, it's a great thing.
It's a good omen.
One down, 17 to go.
They must have smelt the piss and shit.
Have you negotiated your rent down based on the piss incident
and the fact that you have to catch a mouse every week?
Did you guys hear my latest debacle with the whole piss incident?
Well, the fact that you got a free mattress coming, but you bought a mattress and now you
can't use the free mattress. Somebody brought up a good point that you should donate it.
I think that would be a cool thing to do. And obviously the sponsor would be happy about it.
Just somebody, somebody would, would definitely need a new mattress.
I like that idea. Like that idea a lot.
Yo Grinnelly quickly though, for everyone out there that, you know,
you've said they didn't, the renter's insurance is being covered.
Grinnelly told me this and left this part out.
The accident happened and then he called to try to get renter's insurance.
So he didn't like, you know, this kid didn't have it.
He tried to squeeze the system like a little weasel and he got busted on it.
So that you left that part out.
Yeah, so 100 my own fault.
But let me preface with this.
I got renter's insurance at 930.
I reported the incident at 953.
So I had renter's insurance.
I'm pretty sure if anyone has a brain at the insurance company,
they're like, dude, oh, this just happened.
That sounds like something all Rays buddies would do.
No, my buddies would have pulled it off.
Oh, man.
But don't bump.
Piece of work, Grinelli.
Wow, fucking RAs buzzing already.
I'm excited for this epi, boys.
Speaking of G's, Biz,
we got the original G coming on
in just a little bit.
Hello, Giroux,
the Philadelphia Flyers.
We had some man rockets last week.
I'll be Hank, and I'll throw G right up there
with the rest of them. Yeah, and
also, I got to be the guy, so I'm going to get
fucking torched for this one.
Ah, fuck. Somebody told me to actually
stop saying that.
That one staying in is a lesson that it's
like that was enough. Come on.
Come on. I do say that
a lot.
Yeah.
And also, we got to thank Budweiser Canada.
They're the ones who who sent us out there out west to get all those awesome interviews.
Gee, do you want to talk a little bit about all the YouTube content that's finally going to be rolling out?
So as of tonight, we are recording on Wednesday.
We will be releasing the trailer for the West Coast Wagon Tour on our YouTube channel.
So that will be the first video we are releasing on the YouTube channel.
And then as the next few weeks go on,
we're going to be pumping out content every day.
Monday, we'll be releasing the podcast.
Tuesday, we'll be releasing
the corresponding video to the podcast.
That's the video.
Oh, people will like that one.
Yeah, it'll be the video interview
that everyone's been asking for.
And then on Wednesdays, we'll be releasing an original content piece.
We have four, five, six, actually, different content pieces.
RA and Biz go to Hollywood.
Biz and Whitney take Venice Beach, amongst many.
And then Thursday, again, we'll be dropping the podcast.
And then Friday, we'll have another corresponding interview of the podcast.
I don't want to give too much away, but fuck, man,
that basketball game is going to make me look real bad.
Hey, I rewatched that.
I've seen that, and I've seen the trailer.
It's just the minute clip you sent me, right, Grinnelly?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yeah, that's funny.
All right, biz, but I did get to see the basketball game.
We can't give too much away.
There was a lot of good parts.
I was so annoying.
I was just nonstop giving it to you.
At least the video is cut that way.
I don't think I stopped talking the entire game,
but still that was,
that was funny.
And it brings back some good memories with Teddy and Bugsy.
You know,
we missed those guys.
Yeah,
it was a good week.
I'm looking forward to seeing those videos.
Speaking of guys with the name G,
Gino Malkin,
he's getting a one game suspension for attempting to Ned Stock,
Michael Raffi in Philadelphia on Monday.
Little Game of Thrones fire there, Biz.
I see you smiling.
Raffel gave him a little bit of a shot behind the head.
A lot of people said he should have been suspended.
I mean, it was a glance and blow, and then Malkin, in retaliation,
turned and swung a stick like a fucking sword,
and he glanced Raffel right off the head.
But, I mean mean if he caught
him he would have fucking easily concussed him but either way the glance and blow got him a one
game suspension uh it's gonna cost him 51 000 and change it was pretty reckless man what's your
take on it what's my take it starts with this for people who haven't watched pittsburgh over the
last 10 12 years evgeny malkin is a psychopath. He has an anger streak in him that comes out.
Not often, I'll say, but there's been many instances
where he gets pissed off.
I mean, I think it's one of the things that makes him as great as he is.
He's a lunatic out there, and he's so good
that you just never really know what's going to happen.
And there he was pissed off.
Two shots in the back of the head.
I think that they weren't overly hard, but obviously they hit him.
And without even thinking, I don't want to say I can see how he did it
or why he did it because it was definitely reckless,
but he's just pissed off.
He's got his little anger streak, and he just throws his stick.
It's one-handed.
And now, mind you, he got a game suspension that didn't even hit him.
That could have been a 20-gamer if it caught him in the jaw.
Ten games, say.
It was like once there was a view of the incident from like the penalty box
where like little Pierre Maguire shits, like that camera,
and you see how hard he swung the stick.
I mean, from the up top regular camera view, yeah, it looks bad.
But when you see actually how much speed was in it,
it could have done some damage. You could tell the whole philly bench stood up shocked and the best part was biz before you give your opinion was after malcolm's like oh fuck he played dirty i
didn't even fucking hit him i added the f i added the f bobs but it was i'm gonna read the quote
it goes uh malcolm goes i didn't hit him in face. If I touched him in the face for sure, I would get suspended.
It's a high stick, but it's not like I broke his face.
I think I don't get suspended.
I've got a Malcolm one game suspension, uh, broke his face.
That's a Malcolm quote, by the way.
Uh, if you could, if you guys want to go get lost on YouTube, go, go watch some Malcolm
interviews, like in between periods and shit
where the IM score or whatever.
Yeah, I think he got a little reckless there.
He is a bit of a snapshot.
There's a clip somebody posted as well when he two-handed Callahan
Medieval Times Dinner tournament style a few years back.
But yeah, he's a competitor.
And sometimes when you're out there 45 seconds, a minute in your shift,
and you're getting a couple cross-checks in the back
or a punch in the head, your wires cross a little bit,
and that split second where he turned around and flung his stick,
it's like, fuck, it's too late.
No backing out now.
You're committed, ends up clipping him.
I'm just happy no damage was done
because you don't want to lose an NHL star
to the lineup for 15 games off a little stupid mistake.
A lot of people are upset because, you know,
attempt to injure was there.
You know, I expected maybe more, maybe two, maybe three games.
Obviously, the raffle kind of initiated.
The good news is I'm heading to that stadium series game,
Philly-Pittsburgh, and he won't be suspended for that so that's kind of nice and it'll kind of enhance that rivalry
which of course it needed anything else to get it going yeah and i think partly when you have
one hand on your stick you're kind of thinking oh how much damage can i do but when you get some
fucking lag on it like ser Sergio Garcia, you can take
somebody's head off. So maybe you have a one hand. You just didn't realize how strong he was.
And I mean, I'm not saying this is going to happen. It's a different league now. But
if someone from, you know, Philly tried fighting Malkin for that, he probably would, you know,
depending on who it is, like he's not afraid to drop the glove. So we'll see what happens.
It being an outdoor game and him being a superstar
and it just being a different league, maybe not.
But you never know when Philly and Pittsburgh get together.
The last thing I wanted to see, I had money on the Penguins,
three-nothing lead with five minutes left.
And then he scored quick.
They did.
They scored quick.
And then basically, you know, they had a six on four for the rest of the game.
So I had to sweat that one out.
But did you see the disallowed goal they called back?
Did you happen to catch that one?
Oh, that was a bad one and very bad wow i mean yeah matt murray was in goal for pittsburgh i mean it wasn't like he kind of stopped it and they blew a quick whistle they just blew the whistle he
never even had possession of it i should have been an easy goal for philly but again i had money on
pittsburgh so i wasn't going to complain too much but you got to think the referee got a got an email
after the game for that call. Oh,
could you imagine being a ref and blowing that call in Philadelphia?
And you got to get a police escort out of the building.
And you know what?
EJ Radek,
my man at NHL network brought up the point,
the same exact thing happened in game six.
I think, um,
Preds,
um,
penguins in the cup finals.
And it was Murray as well.
And,
and Forsberg put a puck on net and it kind of snuck through him.
No even remotely close part to him covering the puck.
And Sissons banged in it, would have given Nashville a 1-0 lead,
and it was just funny, same exact goalie.
And it's a game of mistakes, right?
Players are making mistakes all game, so refs do also.
But that one kind of pisses me off because him delaying the
whistle by one second, if he has it covered, isn't going to really do anything. And in that one
second, you can just take a stride left or right to see if the puck's behind him. I mean, a quick
whistle there really does no good. I mean, if he's got it covered in his glove, which it kind of
looked like Murray made a nice glove save. Then, you know what?
If you wait an extra second, no big deal.
You blow it down.
But if it's through him, that was a screw drop for Philly.
I mean, you have it right there to be furious.
It's almost like you wish that's reviewable.
I know you can't do that, but that was getting fucked.
So this is going to set the table for that stadium series game.
So the NHL just must be salivating at this.
As a hockey fan in general and a Penguins fan,
I know you Philly fans, it's in Philly,
so I better be careful what I say here.
It's going to be an intense game and just kind of ramps things up.
Sometimes those outdoor games maybe lack a little bit of intensity.
This one will be fucking awesome.
Yeah, you hate to see Philly.
Oh, yeah, and we're going there with New Amsterdam vodka.
Quick shout-out to our sponsor.
Yeah, make sure you're still enjoying those Pink Whitney's out there.
One pot vodka, one pot pink lemonade from New Amsterdam vodka,
and enjoy responsibly as always.
And also, too, when points are at a premium for the Flyers,
they're trying to get in the playoffs, and a goal like that,
they don't get it.
It doesn't count for them.
Man, that's tough, man.
That's a tough fucking nut to take.
So one trade happened since last show.
The Kings continued their fire sale.
They traded 34-year-old center Nate Thompson in a fifth rounder in 2019
to the Habs for a fourth rounder in 2019.
He's a pending UFA, making 1.65 million.
He's got four goals to assist this year with 17 PIMS, averaging 12.55 of ice.
The number that jumped out at me with Thompson,
he's a plus three on a team with a negative 35 goal differential.
So regardless of how you feel about plus minus,
he's obviously doing something all right in his own end.
The Habs are getting themselves a pretty solid center for their fourth line,
a line that hasn't scored since December 29th.
He's also won 53.1 of his face-offs.
So Canadians are getting an upgrade for their fourth line.
The Kings are basically just moving up a few slots in the draft.
So if you're a Habs fan, you've got to like the move.
No biz.
No, all right.
I really like the move.
You know, some people think it's useless,
but to bring in a repairman like that who can win face-offs, especially in the defensive zone,
he can help kill penalties.
Obviously, providing offense isn't really what he's going to bring
unless he goes on a little bit of a hot streak,
but just a guy to help balance that lineup a little bit more.
And, I mean, who knows, man?
That Montreal team might make playoffs,
and that's the type of guy you're going to need
in order to just kind of fill in some holes
yeah and
Bergevin made it clear he wasn't going to make a big
splash or mortgage any of the future
but that's the type of move that can help
you in the playoffs a veteran and also
I mean yeah like you said Biz Montreal gets in
and the bell center
crazy time come play off.
Is that good French?
Either way, that place is nuts.
So it'll be fun when they're in.
I actually root for Montreal to be in there.
For Astro reasons.
Every guy in the league is just like,
God damn, get all those Canadian teams in there.
Get them all in there and then go on long runs.
I don't care if we lose.
Yeah, it's not a huge
pickup for the kings i mean basically they're going to move up a few slots in the draft uh they
probably figured he's going anyways might as well get something for him even though if it's not a
huge thing um so yeah canadians got a little stronger down the middle uh there's an incident
in a u.s hockey league game the other night flight flames prospect martin uh pospacil a 19 year old
slovak he was a fourth-round pick in 2018.
He had a little skirmish in the fans in Omaha.
He was in the penalty box per Flames Nation, which is a well-known Flames blog.
They said the Omaha fans had thrown some trash on him while he was in the penalty box.
He responded in kind.
They threw the trash back at him, so then he stepped up on the bench.
He tried to climb over the petition in the stands. He was grabbed by some adult in the area and led away from the arena.
Pretty hectic scene.
Did you happen to catch that, Wits?
I mean, these kids are 18 years old and the people throwing fucking trash at them.
Grow the fuck up, no?
Yeah, crazy situation.
I mean, listen, I also want to mention that there's a lot of, like, useless things you see in life.
I don't know, like, for example, you think of, like, if there were domes left in business hotel room, useless, the useless,
most useless thing I've ever seen in a rink is that little piece of glass above
the fans. Did you see that behind where the whole incident was?
What is that doing?
Either put glass behind there or don't have anything at all.
It made no sense. It led to the entire,
not led to the entire incident, but made it easier to happen.
The kid lost his mind. Talk about wires crossing, Biz.
I just, I was surprised to see, you know, it took a little while to break up.
I mean, it got bigger than I thought it would get.
But still, I mean, you don't want to see that shit.
I guess people probably loved it.
But, you know, you could think both teams are kind of embarrassed by the whole situation.
I still haven't got the full word on how it all took place.
I will say this.
whole situation i still haven't got the full word on how it all took place i will say this i've sat in some penalty boxes where fans are just ruthless and they say ridiculous shit and you know some
people's comments will be like well he's a he's an nhl draft pick and he's got to hold himself to
a higher standard fuck you if you fucking throw something at me i don't give a fuck if you want
to fire me because someone threw something at me i went over and socked him in the face I don't give a fuck. If you want to fire me because someone threw something at me, I went over and socked him in the face, I don't give a shit.
I'm not going to succumb to fucking being the better man.
Lick my fucking ass.
You'd make Ron Artest look like a Lady Bing winner.
You'd lose your mind.
Have I ever had  okay, so there used to be this guy in Kitchener
when we used to play against the Rangers in the OHL.
He used to give it to me behind the penalty box.
I would always just say, like, fuck you back and start ripping into him.
When I played against the Toledo Storm when I was with the Wheeling Nailers,
shout out to the Nailers, we played in Toledo.
The glass was, as you described, it was probably two feet tall
along the neutral zone.
In the end zone, it's a little taller.
But there would be a guy with a megaphone, and he would chirp me the whole game
because I was kind of the guy who would stir the pot.
I would fight.
And I said something that was pretty regrettable once.
He was on me pretty hard, and I stood up, and I looked at him.
I said, is that your girl?
And he goes, yes. I said, I wouldn't fuck her with that guy's dick and point it at I stood up and I looked at him. I said, is that your girl? And he goes, yes.
I went fucker with that guy's dick and pointed at some like big fat fucker next to him.
And I'd kind of been joshing back and forth with him all game a little bit,
but I had remained pretty calm.
But he just kind of went over the edge.
And man, it was literally when I was skating by on the ice,
he has this megaphone in my face.
And after I said it, I felt kind of bad.
And even our coach was like hey
man yeah you know that take it easy a little bit but in toledo you had to walk out through the
concourse and onto the bench and you were sitting right next to the fans so everything they were
saying you could hear it uh but uh you know i i'm in you're a fucking peasant if you go to games to
chirp at kids and throw trash at them so i'm sure the real story or the full story will roll out slowly here
and people will be messaging us.
But, hey, if he got something thrown at him,
I'm okay with him going at the other guy.
Yeah, I can't imagine the teenager in the penalty box
started something with the fans.
I mean, like I said, the Flames Nation blog did say the Omaha fans did start it.
There hasn't been any discipline announced yet, so we'll see what happens and that kind of uh brings up a topic boys what are the most epic uh
altercations with fans and players and and uh okay i'll let you take that one away right now
then talk about that one i just i just remember i remember the clip of him just against the glass
and he just thinks he's never going to get touched.
He's so cocky.
And then it breaks through, and you just see Ty Domi just string him out.
The guy, first of all, he falls on his face,
and then Domi pretty much lifts him up, and he's just got leverage on him,
just unloading on the guy's face.
I'll never forget that one.
And then I think you see players actually skate and jump into the penalty box
or tried to along with the linesmen or the refs.
But a crazy  I don't want to say it was playoffs.
I don't know.
Either way, I remember I was actually watching the game live just like,
holy shit, this is awesome.
That's why I said if you're watching that, it's so not normal.
You see it so rarely that it's actually incredible to view.
The other one was the Rob Ray one.
And the reason why
that one, I put it above it, is
because after the game, Rob Ray got
interviewed about the altercation and how it
all went down. Grinnell, I need
you to find and roll this clip right
now. You know, we're kind of wondering, what's this guy
going to do? So, you know, we weren't going
to really wait to give him the chance of,
you know, who knows what he's going to do, you know, all those things that
happened. So, you know, as soon as he jumped, we, you know, we sort of just threw him up, chance of you know who knows what he's going to do you know all those things that happen so you know as soon as he jumped we you know we sort of just threw him
up and you know hopefully that was going to be the end but he came right back so and then that's
when we sort of took a little force to him and tried to slow him down or tried to get him out
of there and uh you know by that time the police had come and they took him away but if you go back
and watch how it all went down, he completely fabricates what happened,
but it's comical because he keeps a straight face the entire time.
Brad Richardson's actually a guy who made me aware
of the post-game interview.
I'd never seen it.
So once you roll that audio, people have a good hoot,
especially if you've seen how it all transpired.
And R.A., do you have one for us?
I do.
First, I just want to say I was kind of hoping that guy in Omaha
leaned into the penalty box just like that happened with Ty Domi,
so he could have fallen in, so this kid could have put a beating on him.
But my favorite, I mean, it's the holy grail of fan fights.
In 1979, it was life imitating art.
The Boston Bruins going into Madison Square Garden and fighting the fans.
It was years after Slapshot.
Slapshot came out a couple years before that.
So the fact that a professional team went into the crowd to fight the crowd
years after that movie came out is even more funny.
But, yeah, that's the all-time classic fan fight.
I mean, Millberry beating a guy with his shoe.
I mean, what more can you add to that?
That's like the GOAT where you just try to talk about other ones besides that one
because it's so the number one.
The other great one was, remember, I think,
I don't know when it was.
I feel like it was the 80s, but some dude
hopped over the glass and was running around
the ice and he got laid out.
Oh, yeah. They took him off on a stretcher.
Somebody hit him from behind into the wall.
Oh, yeah. Somebody ran him over.
Somebody, dude, absolutely.
The 80s were fucked.
70s and 80s were out of control.
Back then, if you drank and drove and the cop pulled you over he just like put you in the back
of his not saying that that that's okay it was just like it was just a different world back then
not everyone was uh you know out to get everyone and i mean would you agree i'm already i'm sure
you have buddies where if they were drinking and driving back in the day that a cop pulled them over and was like,
all right, just jump in the back of the cruiser.
I'll bring you home.
Leave your car here.
Yeah, if they knew the cop or even more likely to just say, all right, just fucking leave your car here and get a cab.
They'll even call a cab.
And they go rob a bank together.
Yeah.
I like that scene in the town.
Remember that scene in the town when they go to park the car and the cop's sitting there looking at them?
Remember that scene in the town when they go to park the car and the cop's sitting there looking at them? Remember that scene, Biz?
The only scene I remember is when he was talking to the girl in the bar and you could see the cook's head.
Yeah, that's the only time.
That's all I got either.
That clip, Biz, the cop sitting there,
that was actually based on an actual incident.
Guys just were doing a score and they parked to go switch the cars
and there was a cop sitting there working a detail.
And he froze.
He looked.
He's like, what am I going to do here? and he basically just let them go because fucking it was four
against one that was based on an actual incident i also boys i wrote something down my notes that
really grinds my gears um if you message us saying hey how come you haven't talked about
this on the podcast and we've literally covered it in the last two episodes that means
you're not listening so you if you fucking message me something like that like hey dude why aren't
you talking about the red wings it's like we fucking did 48 hours ago it was on the last
podcast did you not listen to the podcast so from now on and then they're just trying to
chirp early from now on we're going to put these
people on blast on the main account is that is that fair grinnell so we give everyone the pre-warning
are they even worth the attention though somebody i just i kind of like to do it now but but now
now it'll prevent people from doing it because if you do it then like everyone is going to roast
them we're getting we're getting everyone involved what grinds my gears? It just happened
to me. I'm just bringing this up because you brought up
the grinding of the gears.
When you're waiting to turn left
on a light, okay,
and the fucking light's green,
right, and you're going to take a left, but
the traffic's coming the other way. You know, both ways
have green. It's not one that has an arrow for
the green. Those are great. It's one when you got to
do your own work.
If you don't pull out to the middle of the intersection and then fucking go when it's yellow and the other stars cars stop going you're you're an asshole it drives me insane people stay
on the white line get out there and you'll take the left when the other ones stop and then you
can get a couple cars going i agree with it just happened but i didn't mean to no no that's okay you let it out
buddy it's so is that is that not so annoying to see wit in a road raid and uh road raid incident
what about wit when people don't take a left on red you can actually do that massachusetts if
you're on a one way taking a left turn onto another one way you can actually go that's like
common sense a lot of people would be surprised at how many fucking
people don't know it. Anyways, enough of the boring car talk. Let's go to that handsome son
of a bitch on the Philadelphia Flyers, Claude Giroux, right now. And it's also brought to you

I like to welcome to the show a guy who's in San Jose for his sixth All-Star game.
He's in his 12th season with the Philadelphia Flyers.
He has a career,.93 points per game in his 786-game career.
Welcome to Spit and Chicklets.
Claude Giroux, or G as they call him.
Thanks for having me, boys.
I've been listening to you guys for a while, so pretty excited about this.
Well, you've been dodging us for a bit.
Like I said, I was a little nervous.
You guys are a little outgoing.
You know me.
I'm a little shy guy.
Oh, yeah, you're so shy, G.
That's what everyone says when they meet you.
Yeah, I'm shy, so I'm out of my comfort
zone here by doing this, but I'm very
excited. You gotta put that mic a little closer
to your mouth when you talk. I know you don't want to
mess up those nice new teeth you got.
When did you get those? Holy shit.
Yeah, you saw that? Holy.
You can really tell though, can you?
They look great for my wedding pictures
though. Everybody tells me I got a great smile.
Hey, buddy, congrats.
Thanks, man.
Any kids?
That was this summer, yeah.
Man down, dude.
Oh, my invite must have got lost.
Broke into prison.
It was awesome.
He's like, Biz, you can come to the awards with me, but you can't come to my wedding.
Maybe that's when I got the uninvited.
You're a Vegas guy.
You're not wedding guy.
That's not your scene.
I remember that.
You're like, hey, G, bring anybody for the NHL Awards in Vegas?
I'm like, no.
He's like, hey, can I have your plus one, man?
Like free hotel, like free dinners.
I like free things, right?
I'm like, yeah, sure.
Let's do it.
Yo, the best part of that story is it always, to me, was told, yeah, Drew invited me to
the All-Star Game as his plus one.
And he comes on.
He's like, yeah.
He just kind of asked for the plus one.
Well, I don't know.
It kind of happened.
It was a couple of weeks before we kind of asked for the plus one. Well, I don't know, it kind of happened. It was a couple weeks
before we were in Montreal
for the F1.
Legit,
two of the best weekends
of my life.
Probably two
in my top five.
All I remember
from that weekend
is Mike Commodore.
He didn't have a cell phone
or a wallet
for three days
and he's like,
yeah,
I'll just meet up
with you guys later.
I'm like,
how are we going
to communicate
with this guy?
And he was always there.
He always found a way to get there.
I was like, this guy's nuts.
No wallet, no phone.
For literally three days.
That trip, I planned on going for three days.
I ended up staying for five.
The cold sweats I had after it.
But the amount of partying was worth it.
We had Commodore.
Oh, here's a story for you.
I don't know if G was with us.
For the sake of your marriage, you weren't.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no.
It was a story.
We went to Cirque du Soleil.
And there was about eight to ten of us in the front row, all hockey guys.
And these girls get up on stage.
They do their thing, like crazy acrobats.
And then now they become the people that go in the audience.
It's like a mystique.
And I think it was St. Pierre gets something thrown off his chest.
It was like a little something.
And I noticed it, too.
And I looked at him.
He looked at me.
And he's like, so it was a little piece of paper.
We unraveled it.
And it was all the fucking girls' numbers.
Wow, biz.
That were in the app.
Yeah.
So we didn't end up going meet none of them.
Because obviously we looked at the game notes and checked the program.
I've never seen Marty so excited, though.
Marty was pretty pumped about that move.
Well, he was finally taller than one of them,
so he was fucking so jacked up.
And that was an unbelievable weekend.
That was during the heydays, and yeah, that was
Boyd Gordon was there.
He was another guy.
Oh, yeah.
He didn't say a word for three days, but he had a smile on the whole time.
Gordo is a weird cat.
He won't come on the podcast.
He won't even come on Biz's Instagram.
Biz tries to Instagram me, like, hi.
It's just like you just hear stories of Gordo.
No clue what he's really like.
He just sits there, had a beer in his hand, and just people watched the whole time.
Took it all in.
Oh, yeah.
Well, dude, Ari said this is your sixth All-Star game.
I mean, that's just incredible in its own right.
But do you still enjoy coming here, right?
It felt different at the beginning, but now it's like, you know,
you almost want the break, but you still got to represent the squad.
Yeah, at first, the first few ones were pretty nice.
You know, we play with great players, and you're really excited about it.
And, I mean, usually it's the same players that come the years after.
I mean, I think the first few ones, the first one in Carolina and then Ottawa,
that was a good time.
You've had some tough cities.
Where's L.A., Dallas, and New York?
Well, it's a little different for me.
Ottawa is home for me.
Okay, that's true.
So that was pretty cool.
But, yeah, Nashville was pretty fun too.
Oh, man, that would be great.
A couple of good cities too.
Yeah, that's big time.
Who are you looking forward to playing with out there?
I mean, I know I was saying
to Conor McDavid the other night
not a big deal we had him on.
So you're like a pigeon
on our podcast.
No offense, Conor.
You know, like,
you guys are usually your rivals.
These guys need a vision.
Now you're teammates with them.
So, like, there must be
some guys you want to play with
though because they're so creative.
I know Sid's probably
an obvious guess.
Oh, God, yeah.
That's got to be uncomfortable.
That was a hit.
That was a hit and a half, dude.
It's a little...
It's better now, but I remember
the first world championship we went to
and he was late to come
and the first practice we had
and then we go for a team lunch
after. I'm doing my
plate. It's like a brunch and I'm done
with my plate and
everybody knows about me and Sid. It's like on the ice. We'm done with my plate, and everybody knows about me and Sid.
It's like on the ice.
We were like rivals, and all I can hear is Nate McKinnon be like,
hey, gee, I got a spot right beside Sid.
Let's go.
Come here.
It breaks the ice.
Everybody started laughing, and it was all good after that.
That's such a hockey thing.
You're like, no, I'm good.
Yeah, I'm all set, actually.
You shoot check, Sid.
He's like, sorry, Sid, it wasn't me.
What else do we have for you?
I had to ask, which, you know, this year obviously hasn't gone as you guys hoped in Philly,
but it's been 12 years now for you.
So there's been a lot of ups, a lot of downs.
But what's it like playing in that city?
I mean, a lot of times I call them Philly scumbags.
You know, I went out as a Pittsburgh guy.
I know you disagree with that.
But what's it been like to be a Flyer so far in your entire
career? I know you don't like Philly, but
you know what? They're crazy.
They're crazy. And they know it
and they love it.
You go to Eagles games, you go tailgating,
and it's another level.
What did you guys do for the Super Bowl last year?
We actually went downtown, watched it as
a team. It was a good
time and ended up in the streets with all the fans.
And it was about two, three million people in the city.
And the whole, everybody was just going crazy.
Yeah, they were just going nuts.
A couple cocktails.
People crying and stuff.
I know.
It was something to remember for sure.
Scott Hartnell, I texted him.
I said, give me some ammo.
Oh, I need a Hartsy story too.
Yeah,
we're going to get some Hartsy stories,
but ask him about his dart game,
how I roasted him every night.
You probably lost a few bucks to him,
eh?
Well,
we ended up going to Buffalo Billiards in Philly,
and we played pool,
I dust him at that,
and then we started playing darts for some reason,
me,
him,
and Jake Voracek,
and Jake likes to gamble a little bit when we compete,
so we started betting darts.
And I thought I was okay at darts, but I'm not very good, I guess.
But I love to compete.
So he would make me win a few games, and then I would just ante the price up.
And then he would just clean me out.
And I refuse to play against him now.
He just hustled me hard.
I see.
He hustled you then, huh?
And he would text you that.
It's the only thing he ever
beat me at that's the first well then he texted he's a terrible athlete and let me get my he goes
ask him about that move that turns my crank ha ha ha ha ha ha i don't even know what it means
i don't know what it means i'm looking forward to this one i just go um i go to the center ice i got
speed they're coming at me so i fake go wide And I put it between The guy's stick
And skate
And it kind of went over
Like you probably
Don't know that move
To be honest
But
But like
I would play with Hartsy
And when I started
Doing that move
All I could hear
In the background
Is Hartsy
Ho
And then
And I'm like
Looking back
You're like catch up Hartsy
And then I go back
To the bench
It's like gee
You gotta do that move
More often
I get so excited When you do that move And then I do a few Turnovers like, catch up, Hartsy. And then I go back to the bench. He's like, gee, you got to do that move more often.
I get so excited when you do that move.
And then I do a few turnovers like that, and Coach will yell at me.
He'll be like, don't listen to Coach.
Keep doing that move.
Every time. So when he watches my game and I do it, I get a text from him.
I'm like, hey, man, that move was sick.
He just recently started doing some work at NHL Network,
and I was getting off the shift as he was coming on.
He looked phenomenal, too.
He's got the long hair going.
I'm like, God,
Hartsy, you look great in that suit. He goes, don't act so surprised Whit.
He's always got the one-liners.
He doesn't stop. I remember I watched
him the first or second time he was on
and there was just a close-up on him and he knew
that the camera was on him and he was going like this
with his hair and I'm just like, I can't watch this guy.
Can't take him serious. Yeah, I'm not
taking anything he says serious for sure.
You guys had some good teams there. Do you have any good Hartsy
stories before we move on? Anything that's like
we can say on TV?
You know, Hartsy,
the most impressive thing about Hartsy,
we played cards on the plane
and he was sitting beside me for about six
years, five years, and seriously
I've never seen somebody fart so much.
Oh, this was brought up
when we had him on it's disgusting like we actually like had to stop the game once in a while
and be like we can't we have five minute break guys we go for walks come back but like it's like
he's consistent at it it's like every five minute there's like a bomb that goes off and then we have
to take a time out and like it's just a bird dog but it's impressive he wouldn't hold it he wouldn't
hold it oh no there's no there's no shame in him.
Is it because he didn't want to shit on the plane?
But you almost be better off.
I don't know what he eats, to be honest.
It's something he eats, for sure.
Is he really gritty?
Is he really gritty?
How much have you had to talk about gritty this season?
Gritty's here right now.
Gritty is seriously, when the fans were booing him
the first preseason game, I was probably in there
booing too.
After that, he just took over
and no one cares about the players
anymore. They just want to meet Gritty.
It's insane. I got family and friends
coming over and they want Gritty
t-shirts. It's all about Gritty.
He's pretty selfish, but
people appreciate him. It's all about him. There's not a mascot who embodies their's all about Gritty. He's pretty selfish, but people appreciate him. It's all about him.
It's all about him.
And there's not a mascot who embodies their city more than Gritty.
Obviously, you've seen the tattoo of Gritty sniffing lines.
I didn't see that.
A guy got a tattoo of it.
It was R.A.
Show him, R.A.
I got to pull it up.
Actually, speaking of plays, how impressed have you been with the player, 20-year-old goaltender, Carter Hart?
You guys called him up.
He's like your future. Yeah, basically
he called him up probably earlier than the organization probably
wanted to, but he's 20 years old. He's got
a 266 GAA, 918
save percentage. Pretty impressive for a young kid, no?
Yeah, you don't see a lot of goalies that are 20
and they come in the league and kind of do what he's
doing right now.
He's impressive. We had a lot of goalies he's doing right now. And he's impressive.
I mean, we had a lot of goalies this year.
I think we tied a record seven.
And then obviously he came in, and the way he played,
it's pretty  you have to shake your head at him.
It's pretty impressive and great attitude.
You know, goalies are a little different sometimes.
He's pretty normal for a goalie, you'd say.
And, you know, he's just a shy kid just a shy kid, and he's 20 years old.
What did you expect?
Where were you when you were 20?
I was wetting my bed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,
sleeping in for a game because I went out the night before
and didn't sweat it out enough in pregame skate.
I wanted to ask you about Voracek.
What do they call him, The Champagne Don or something?
Because every time he goes out to the club, he bottles service.
The Czech Jesus, too.
Czech Jesus.
Or him and Pasta running around together this weekend, maybe?
Czechs are animals.
Jake is hilarious.
I mean, he's got that crazy hair, crazy beard.
He just doesn't want to cut it.
He just refuses to.
And, you know, puck drops and he's an animal.
Yeah, he's ready to go.
He's an animal.
I don't want to go back to Gritty, but I have to.
That one where it was Jake Voracek without his beard,
and then he had like a little scruff and then a full beard.
And then it just transformed to Gritty.
He had me in tears.
I was like, that's enough internet for tonight.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Someone actually got that on their body.
Very interesting. Hey, I got a question.
Going back the year you go into the
cup finals, just because I experienced getting
that far and losing, it's heartbreaking,
but do you have any memories of that?
Because I always think back to
certain games on the run there, things like that.
What are your thoughts on that season? That was
crazy. It's my second year.
I'm starting to play a little bit more, third-line center,
and getting a chance to play in the NHL full-time.
And then in the last game of the season, we went in shootouts to get in.
Oh, fuck, that was against the Rangers.
Against the Rangers, yeah.
I forgot that was that year.
And then after that, we were down 3-0 in series against Boston,
came back and beat them in 7.
And down 3-0 in the game.
But it's just the whole.
I might have blacked out there.
Did you talk about how you got in because of the penalty shot?
Yeah, he did.
Shootouts.
Shootouts.
So we had two games left in the season.
And we needed two points to get in.
So we played in New York, lost that game.
So last game of the season against Rangers again, back-to-back.
It goes to shootout. And whoever wins the shootout goes in the playoffs. So it's of the season against Rangers again, back to back. It goes to shootout and whoever
wins the shootout goes in the playoffs.
So it's nerve wracking.
Did you shoot?
Did you shoot?
I was living with Danny Breer at the time
and we were sitting the night before
and we're like, what if this goes in shootouts?
We're probably going to have to go.
So we're like, that'd be pretty sick.
But it's obviously nerve wracking. And up he goes, he go. You guys have to go. Yeah, so we're like, that would be pretty sick. But, like, it's obviously nerve-wracking.
And up he goes.
He scores.
And I go third one.
And it's tie at that point.
I remember Hank was goalie.
And I go in.
I'm like, I'm going to shoot high glove on him.
I go, and I can't see a hole at all.
I say, okay, low blocker, nothing.
I'm just like panicked.
Whoa, whoa, you're looking up?
Yeah.
Oh, you were looking up the block?
You don't do that, eh?
Oh.
But then I get close, and I kind of panicked and kind of saw 5-0,
so I went 5-0, scored.
Gamer.
Gamer, thank you.
But, yeah, that was a sweet feeling.
But like you said, you go into the Stanley Cup finals early in your career
and you're like, ah, I'm going to get back there again.
I know.
No problem.
Yeah, and since then it it's not even a sniff.
Whit was talking about it today,
about how Gary Roberts gave a speech to us then.
We ended up losing, obviously,
but he said, you don't understand how hard this is.
He's getting emotional.
He was a savage.
And then I remember being like, oh my God, he's right.
Sure enough, I didn't even sniff the playoffs,
I don't think, again.
So it's true.
But even though it's a loss, I'll remember that run the rest of my life.
I'm sure it's the same for you.
That Chicago team was just their fourth.
It was like buffling.
It was just they had everyone.
They were too good.
Oh, yeah.
We had a good team, too.
I mean, we had Prongs and Kimo back there.
Prongs took over the playoffs.
That guy was insane in the biggest games.
I know.
He played 30 minutes.
Not even a sweat.
And how about he's like, let's fucking go, boys.
He gets on guys if they're struggling.
No, he's not scared of calling out guys.
We had a few episodes, me and him, but good ones.
No way.
Good ones, yeah.
We probably love that you gave it back to him, though, I bet.
Well, I don't know.
I was scared.
We're up 4-2.
I did give it back to him.
It was my second year, 4-2. I didn't give it back to him. It was my second year, 4-2.
I go a blue line turnover, and I go back three on two the other side,
and they get a shot.
They don't score, and I'm in front of the net, and he just looks at me.
He goes, gee, what the fuck is that?
No more fucking turnovers.
He just yelled at me, and the whole building was quiet,
so everybody can hear it, and I was embarrassed.
I was pissed.
So after the game, I go up to him, and I was so furious. I was well it's here it's prongs like i gotta take it and i went up to him
and i'm like hey don't ever fucking yell at me you want to yell at me behind closed door yell at me
like i can take it but not in front of everybody right and then i'm walking away i'm i'm i'm
shaking my pants now he's gonna he's gonna knock me out chair goes by your head but all i can i
can see is he's coming behind me he's coming i'm just kidding this is not good and then he comes up and he's like okay you're right g i apologize
you know like we can't do that and it was like i was i was pretty impressed how like we just
put it behind us right away it was creative conflict i call it like i mean hey you guys
just want to win and yeah eight games dude it's gonna be you know you made a mistake
but i i kind of agreed with him so it it was like, he just put it behind us. It was good.
But he's a great leader.
It's the way he plays in the playoffs.
It's impressive what he's able to do.
We saw Kimo Teeman yesterday just having lunch.
He walked by.
He's a little fire hydrant, huh?
He's hilarious, though.
He's interviewing guys.
He seems like he's funny.
I've never met him.
Yeah, you'd love him.
You'd love him.
He's hilarious.
Him and Hartz are basically best friends.
We got along very well together.
Where's he from?
Finland?
Yeah.
Never met a bad Scandinavian.
Exactly.
Except for when Jarkko Rutu catfished me with a woman.
That was a Finnish man.
Whoa, what happened?
We've told that story.
That story has been told.
Well, dude, it's actually hot on this podcast.
Oh, my God.
I'm sweating my balls off.
Come on, dude.
I know
Just before we go
What's up for tonight
What are your skills
Puck control
So we'll go through pucks
And then go around
And you gotta put on your stick
Or something
Put in the hole
Just easy work for you though bud
We'll see
You still spending your summers in Ottawa
Yeah I'm in Ottawa
My wife's from there
We have our family friends down there
So it's always good to go back there
You got a couple kids now too
I do not have a couple kids. No way.
That's a good one, Biz. Biz read it on the internet.
He's like, must be true. Wikipedia, man.
Do my research.
Lock it in Wikipedia.
What are you guys doing for the skills? Are you doing anything?
We're actually just, we're going to be
funneling New Amsterdam vodka, and then
whoever gets it down first actually wins the prize.
So that's our sponsor. Also a league
sponsor. And we should mention that video that keeps going viral about when we're at the All-Star game.
People love it.
It's a little premature now, but the girl asked me, how do you guys pick up chicks?
And I'm like, I usually just pour vodka down their throat.
New Amsterdam vodka.
That really works nowadays.
Yeah.
And I go from a 6 to an 8, and it's good night, Jim Kite.
Oh, that's on that clip?
Oh, yeah, and like feminists, like it pops up every once in a while.
Obviously, like I wouldn't say that nowadays, and under the circumstances, 2019, you get smoked for everything.
Like I'm going to the NHL Awards thinking I'm going to get some questions.
All the questions are for him.
For Biz.
Yeah, like say something stupid, you donkey, and I did.
Like Biz, you think you'll do porn someday?
He's like, no, I don't know.
I never even checked into my room at the win that they gave us for free
because I was at the Cosmopolitan. I don't think I
left Marquis that entire trip.
I don't think I saw you the whole weekend.
So to cap off the trip, Henrik
Lundqvist ended up winning his first Vesna.
And we just had him on today as one of
our interviews.
But it was one of the best weekends of my life.
Two of the top five were with you, buddy.
I appreciate you coming on.
You're the man.
Thanks for coming on, buddy.
Thanks for having me, guys.
Insane career, dude.
Keep going.
Congrats on the teeth, man.
Those look unbelievable.
Yeah, those chompers are phenomenal.

that was long overdue um a bit of a shaky story with him saying that i called him begging him to
go to the awards i i think he gave me the invite let's just stick with that story uh obviously you
thank you to budweiser canada and wit do you think do you think G is going to get on this golf trip of your guys? Because he seems very amped up about it, and he likes to play.
Yeah, he's like, I love to golf.
I love to gamble.
Is there any way I can get on that trip at some point?
I was like, dude, 100.
We ever need a guy.
I actually texted him.
I said, listen, I think right now we're waiting to hear one to kind of line it up, finish it.
But, yeah, he'd be a great addition.
He loves golf.
And, also, he scored, oh, yeah, he'd be a great addition. He loves golf.
And also, he scored, oh, what a goal the other night in Minnesota.
He came up with a blue line biz and didn't look down for one second,
just stared up.
I think it was Dubnik, who's our boy.
But either way, stared up the entire time, never looked down,
wound it up for a clap, or you think, like, what's he going to do?
Just shelf.
So, Drew, I don't think gets enough respect. I think for some reason, he doesn't get talked
about enough. But thank you very much for
coming on. Are we going to the voicemails now?
I think we are, boys. So, let's explain
it here. So, we're going to do some voicemails.
How did this work?
We've dropped the voicemail line last night,
basically asked our fans any
chirps, any jokes, any stories,
basically anything that they want to tell us
or get on the podcast, they can
submit a voicemail and I'll go through
the best. I went through about, I don't know, I'd say
200 of them last night and I pulled the best
20. I sent the guys...
You're still alive right now. You didn't fucking
kill yourself based on some... You got 200?
That's not bad. Oh, no.
We got probably a little more than that, but
to each his own. I can only do so many.
You're only human, Michael. Only uh so i went through all the videos i sent i titled each one as how i would describe it in three or four words and then i sent the guys a list of all the
titles i asked the guys to each pick two of the titles that they thought would be funny or that
they wanted to talk about so we'll uh we'll start off here with R.A.
And the title is Kids Smoking R.A.'s Hash.
Well, boys, I was calling the Chicklets podcast,
and smoking a little bit of the hash R.A. style.
I got one question for the boys.
Who's the biggest bender you've seen actually in the NHL?
Who do you think would take their ankles up?
That's my question.
The biggest bender?
Christ, I got to sound depressed.
Holy shit, buddy.
How many times?
I mean, what was he, half asleep?
He was sleeping in the RA hash. It was RA.
I couldn't tell what you said. I race style hash.
I thought you might've given him the hash. I don't know.
Biggest bender. I don't know if he means current or, or Prado.
I'm the last guy to fucking pick on anybody skating, man. I don't,
I don't know. I mean,
that's kind of tough to just throw someone right under the bus.
I do remember, Biz, was it Frankie Lessard?
I was just going to say him.
Yeah, well, I just know that I think it was a full roll of clear tape
on every ankle.
Okay, so Frankie Lessard was a guy who played in Arizona.
He actually got called up because he got suspended in the minors,
and they had to pay him a certain amount that year,
so they just called him up to the NHL when I was with the team.
He couldn't play because he was obviously suspended.
And he would bag skate.
And like you said, he would use about a full roll of clear on each ankle.
Right?
For every skate.
Yeah, and you need knee and ankle flexion when you're skating.
That's how you get a proper stride.
So he would do bag skates with this guy,
and he would always go right hot out of the gate.
And then by the end of it, he was fucking doing the chopstick dance on the ice.
He couldn't even bend his knees or ankles,
and he was just waddling down the ice.
He would always finish last.
So I would say Frankie Lessard.
Actually, one of my first nights out in Scottsdale, I went to W,
and this guy shows up with an affliction shirtiction shirt and they're like hey dude like you can't
come in so he went down to the gift shop he bought this like extra medium white shirt his fucking
vein you could see his veins through the shirt is obviously his gold chain it was like a belly top
too and i'm like fuck dude this guy's gonna be hard to wheel with at the W. Sure enough, I ended up pulling.
So Frankie Lessard, hopefully he doesn't get mad.
That guy's one scary motherfucker.
He'll come hunt us down.
Oh, I think with his signing bonus too, instead of buying anything
or putting it in the bank, like buying anything useful,
he put a hot tub in his living room.
He bought a hot tub, put it in his living room in a summer house
in Quebec somewhere.
So that's another Frankie that starts coming to America.
This guy is a treat.
We got to get him on.
Can we get him on?
Yeah.
All right.
You know him.
That hash story kind of took on a mind of its own there.
Yeah, wait.
Actually, quickly before we move on, if you're suspended in the AHL,
you couldn't then come up to the NHL?
Well, he did, but it's just because they had to call him up at some point
to hit his minimum.
I know.
I'm wondering, though, if you get suspended in the AHL,
could you then go play NHL games?
Well, I don't think he was of the caliber to play at the NHL level.
I know.
He used the full roll of tape on his ankles at that point in his career.
But, yeah, nonetheless, he didn't play that year.
All right, next up we have a call from Ari's aunt.
Oh.
Nice.
Shit.
Brian, it's your aunt, Janine.
I just wanted to give you a call
let you know that I straightened out
Benny
I heard him in your room downstairs
in the basement
yelling at you
he was going through your piggy bank
and uh
I just want you to know that
I got your favorite mac and cheese bites ready
and your older brother I just want you to know that I got your favorite mac and cheese bites ready.
And your older brother, he put together a nice video clip of Kyle McClary highlights.
He thought you'd like that.
I straightened up, Benny, so just get your two bum back, all right?
Good night.
Good night. So nice.
Dude, that sounded like when fucking Homer Simpson waspson was calling mr burns and pretending that isn't
actually your aunt correct no that is most certainly not one of my many i just had to check
no he's like you know i don't like mac and cheese bites yeah it's like hello mr burns this is your
mother mrs burns that's what it sounded like i don't know what the fuck they were saying
obviously not my aunt i'm not a huge mac and cheese guy, but shout out for another waffled collar.
I guess I'm a little bit creative.
Don't mind that.
I like that.
I think it was funny.
All right, boys.
Next up, we have a Ryan Whitney apology from an Edmonton Oilers fan.
Oh, hey, how's it going, boys?
My name is Andrew Bennett.
Love the podcast, but I have to actually give you guys an apology,
specifically to you, Wits.
It was about February 15, 2012.
I tweeted out, at Ryan Whitney, I blame that loss on you.
I was being an absolute pigeon, petty Oilers fan.
I think the Oilers must have lost in overtime.
I decided to take my anger out on Twitter and go at you, Wits.
Shortly after, I got blocked on Twitter by Whitney.
Haven't been able to see his tweets at all since.
So I just want to apologize.
Maybe an unblock would be awesome.
It's Andrew Bennett at 97.
If not, though though just wanted to apologize
love the podcast love you guys content
keep it up
wow alright you know what I have a lot to talk to
Andrew about
I appreciate the apology
here's my thing
it's not a true apology if he's done
that since if earlier this
year he tweeted at Clefbomb
that loss is on you it's almost like
the apology is empty so if he learned from being a prick i would say you know what good for you
everyone makes mistakes i appreciate the apology i was also i listen you guys i'm not kidding you
i was blocking like 20 20 people every game i mean i think it was the lockout yeah the lockout
you're 48 games don't know how many i played every game i played i, I think it was the lockout. Yeah, the lockout. You have 48 games. Don't know how many I played.
Every game I played, I was like, block fest.
Since I retired, or since I think I left Edmonton,
I haven't blocked anyone.
Now I just thrive on it.
Now I live for it.
But, God, when I was playing, man, it was tough.
So, I mean, I kind of hate you, Andrew,
but I also really want to thank you because that's nice of you to understand that, you know,
you were being hurtful at a really tough time for me and my ankles.
Okay, so next up we have Chickletate.
Holy fuck, boys.
This is nasty, you fucking Muppet piece of shit.
You two are a bald-headed fuck.
And you wit, you fucking Edmonton hater.
Fuck you, buddy.
This is the best fucking city in the world, man.
Stop hating on the fucking Oilers, you piece of shit.
And Grinnell, you're kind of a beauty.
Take care, boys.
Wow, that's why Grinnell played this one, you piece of shit.
Hey, that's not even that bad, dude.
Give me some more hate.
No, that kid was honestly sitting on the couch next to Andrew,
and he was like, fuck, I'll just call right after you.
We'll even this thing out.
Which one of your buddies was that, Grinnelli?
Oh, I wish I knew.
No, because I picked the two
I picked. What did I say? I did
Whitney Apology and Chicklets Hate.
So I titled it Chicklets Hate
but in my computer it's
Chicklets Hate
slash Grinnelli Love.
Oh, you little pussy.
Alright, so you want more hate though, Biz, you said?
Yeah, somebody teeing off on me.
Alright, here we go. We got drunk Biz hate.
Fuck you,
spitting chicklets. Especially you,
Biz Nass. You think you're so fucking tough.
You're the type of guy that fucking takes the puck
and I just chip it in your fucking area
and then you go get it and I crush you.
Oh, God, this is fucking painful.
Fuck this guy.
You're trying to hide the fucking snow up your nose.
So fucking goddamn good.
Look at you running around
running around your mouth.
Is that Brian Yandel?
Oh, it's like he heard you.
This is a reply. That was terrible.
Jesus, that was fucking brutal. The blood alcohol content on these fucking calls, everybody's like he heard you. Yeah. This is a reply. That was terrible. Jesus. That was fucking brutal.
The blood alcohol content on these fucking calls.
Everybody's shit faced.
So here's the drunk, forgetful Canadian.
Hey, you fucking Muppets.
I goddamn love your show.
I'm a little hammered.
I'm half in the bag, but I'm a Canadian down in America.
And my God, I don't know where I'm going with this.
You know what?
I'm going to call back.
I'm going to do it again.
Dude.
Did he call back?
No, he never called back.
Jesus Christ.
That guy was.
Here's a good question.
Here's a good one you'd like.
NHL Instagram videos.
What's going on, boys?
I'm not sure if you saw this video that was posted by the NHL's Instagram
on Media Day for the Super Bowl that asked Patriots and Rams players
who's Conor McDavid.
They had three choices, a prime minister, a hockey player,
or an award-winning actor.
And it's a 40-second video, and everyone gets it wrong besides the last guy,
which was clearly just a guess.
And I was wondering, do you think this should be something that the nhl is marketing or i just think it's
a little bit embarrassing that these professional athletes don't know the name of one of the best
players never played the game you know if they asked about tom brady the nhl players everybody
knows who the guy is so i just want to know a thought on that. It's an interesting point.
You know, I mean, here's the league saying,
hey, nobody knows who our number one star is
from this other league.
So it's, yeah, it is a good point raised by the call.
Like, why would you publicize the fact
that people don't know your number one star?
Well, here's the thing.
For the most part, in my opinion,
hockey players, more than any other sport,
know, you know, what's going on in other leagues.
They really follow football.
You guys follow baseball.
But you get to those NFL guys.
They live in their own little bubble.
They don't give a shit.
I mean, for the most part, none of them even like hockey, right?
That's the thing.
A lot of NHL guys, they like a lot of other sports.
They played other sports growing up.
Not to say football players didn't, but I don't know.
Do you know what I mean, Biz?
Yeah.
I don't know. I mean, I think if uh yeah i i i don't know i i mean i
think if like you asked who wayne gretzky was they would know so yeah mcdavid's only been around a
few years so i can kind of uh i can understand where they're coming from and they just don't
watch hockey down south like football guys are the last guys to ask they don't care they don't
they don't give a shit and so brady's a little different because he's at the end of his career too.
But now it's the most televised sport in America.
So, yeah, I don't know.
I don't really have an opinion on that.
I don't take offense to it either.
Hockey's growing.
It's going to get there.
By the way, can people stop asking me to ask you two to unblock them?
I get DMs and tweets all the time.
Can you ask Boots to unblock me?
Can you ask Wits to unblock me?
It's like, man, if they blocked you, they blocked you for a reason.
Like, I got better shit to do than track these guys down.
I'm not going to go in.
I wouldn't even know how to go unblock.
That just sucked for them for being really mean to me at one point.
This one is from the BU Bandit.
Ooh.
The Butt Bandit.
Hey, Chicklets.
It's the BU Bandit here.
Make sure to ask Witt about the time he was with the BU softball player
and he had a bloody nose.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Or ask him about Boston College Girl.
BU Bandit, out.
Oh, bringing out the demons.
If BU Bandit, my good buddy Justin Miser, miser that was him i knew it the minute i heard
bu followed by bandit if he thinks i'm going to be going into stories of me back in college
he's crazier than i thought now mind you this is a kid who used to bend over and try to get me
to tape no joke he'd want me to tape like a beard trimmer to a hockey stick so I could be six feet away,
but then shave his cornhole for him.
And I was like, you shut the fuck up right now, Mize, and you get out of my face because
you're one of my best friends, but I'm not doing that.
So the BU bandit bringing up old stories, get out of my face, Mike.
Why wouldn't he just do it himself?
I shaved my own asshole with my clippers.
I'm sure he ended up doing that.
I have like a half guard.
And I got a bloody nose in the gym.
Some softball girl, hello, fired a softball at me.
I wasn't even looking.
Thing buried me in the nose.
So no college stories from Whitcomb anytime soon?
I don't even have any, dude.
I was just focusing on hockey. I'd be in the gym
after games, before games, watching
films of Lidstrom. I was just
not doing calvaries.
Let's
get one more. Let's get one more good one.
Come on. Dude from Finland asking about
Finland? Yeah, that was
next up.
Yo.
Jonas Salo from Finland.
A young plug.
A long time forward liner.
And I have a question for Beast Nasty and Whitney.
Both of them too.
What's your take on Finnish hockey players in the NHL and overall?
Finnish hockey players in the NHL and overall,
what do you guys think are the best three players of all time from Finland?
Thanks, man.
Well, you played with one of them.
I like that.
I like that.
First off, my opinion on Finnish guys,
I don't know if I've ever met a bad one.
They all love having a good time.
They all work hard.
They love to drink, Biz. They get way more chatty the more hard they love to drink this they get way more
chatty the you know the more beers they have i think they start trusting their english better
and they're just funny dudes and they you know they like i just said they play so hard that you
love having them as teammates um three the best three fins of all time timu easy yeah i think
yari curry has to be. Yeah.
And, dude, oh, man, I don't know,
because there's some coming now that could end up being in the top three easy. It's like their country's getting better and better, bringing up more players.
I think we said it last podcast or something.
So, I don't know, Biz.
What's your top three?
Sammy Lapisto, Lowry Korpakoski, and Timu Salani.
Those other two guys other than team
who were guys i play with in arizona and we would run hard those were the glory days when we were
making our runs to the conference finals and and getting bottle service once a week and we would
do post-season vegas trips so shout out to laurie Kopakoski and Sammy Lapisto,
who this guy was a wheel. He's got
twins now, though, married, so he's settled down.
Love you, Sammy. I know you're listening.
Obviously, Timo's probably number
one, if not number two, to Curry.
I would say for a goaltender, Mika Kiprasov,
and for a defenseman,
Teppo Newman. I think he's probably one of the
more underrated defensemen of his era as well.
Coyote.
Yeah.
Tebow Teeman, hell of a career.
We saw him in San Jose, little cigarette machine on skates.
So, all right, thanks, everybody who called in with the voicemail.
Maybe lay off the sauce a little bit before next time or prep a little better,
but we got some nice ones there.
Hopefully, they'll get better as the year wears on.
All right, guys, wait, wait, wait, But we do have one more before we wrap up.
And this one's a bit longer.
It's almost a little over a minute.
And it's a great story. Oh, this better be good then.
It's actually about Biz's dad.
So this is a story about Biz's dad.
I didn't send this in the list because I kind of wanted to surprise you guys with this one.
Hey, guys.
Love your show.
This is a Biz's dad story, so this is fucking hilarious.
So I think it was a couple years ago, Biz, you're still in the league,
and me and my cousin Diddy, we went and got custom Biz Nasty jerseys,
and we're just standing out front of the arena and just having a bullshit,
and this older gentleman comes up to us and goes, holy shit,
those are nice fucking jerseys.
I'm like, oh, thank you.
And he goes, yeah, that's my son.
And I'm like, oh, no way, like, that's awesome.
And he goes, yeah, hopefully you can beat those Pittsburgh cunts tonight.
And I'm like, holy shit.
No, Biz, I get it where you get  I get it where it comes from.
So, anyways, we
Hello?
Anyways, the game
What happened there?
You take a nap?
And we're just outside the rink walking and
we see your dad again we're like hey can we get a picture with you and he's like yeah fuck yeah so
we took a picture of all of us my dad my cousin diddy me and your dad and after the pictures done
he's like hey boys i really got into. Can you help me into my vehicle?
So my cousin Danny and I fucking helped your old man into his vehicle.
And your mom was so thankful and just full of laughs.
And it was actually really entertaining because he couldn't walk anymore.
And what a weapon.
So what I did is my buddy,
JJ used to do the ice in Phoenix and he signed that Jersey.
You got,
he got you to sign my Jersey.
So I framed it with that photo above my desk,
just to remember that memory and how fucking awesome your dad was.
So just wanted to share that story. My fucking awesome your dad was so just wanted to
share that story my name's chris you have more questions he gave his phone number so i had to
cut him off there but biz we've never really heard much about your dad kind of sounds like a legend
oh he's a social butterfly he'll go up and say hello to people at the urinal
dropping c-bombs too he's he's a weirdo like that he'll talk to me i'll talk to anyone too
but uh yeah there was a
period of time there when he used to come to the coyotes games they would fly in arizona and stay
there for a couple months we actually went 11 0 and 1 one time in home games that he attended
during the course of time when he was on vacation there he'd be running up and down the aisles like
high-fiving people and shit like and if you knew him, you'd be like, oh, God, I got secondhand embarrassment.
I would get embarrassed.
But he would come down to the fucking locker room after,
and he'd call Shane Doan.
He'd be like, Sean, great game.
Shane fucking Doan, dude.
My fifth year on the team, Sean Doan.
Like fucking Gino Malkin.
God bless him.
I love my old man.
He's a social butterfly.
He'll talk to anyone.
So I appreciate you guys being nice enough to bring him back to his vehicle.
And, yeah, Cam Bissonette.
Good old Camer.
And before we move on from the voicemails,
I just want to let you know that they were brought to you by Mugsy Jeans.
If you're an athlete, you know how hot it is to find clothes that fit you well.
The truth is men's clothes are not designed for guys with bigger asses and legs, especially when it comes to jeans. Well, I have
good news for you. The answer to your problems is finally here. Mugsy jeans are designed specifically
for dudes like us. Mugsy was started by a stoolie who was tired of having his balls choked out in
jeans. His goal was simple. Reinvent men's jeans to look good and feel outrageously comfortable.
I got Mugsy jeans and they are by far the most comfortable jeans I've ever had.
This stoolie spent five years working with industry experts and athletes from
former NHL players and Hobie from a former NHL player and Hobie Baker winner,
Blake Jeffron to perfect the feel and fit of his jeans.
The magic is in Muggsy's proprietary denim,
which is made from a bunch of high-tech materials that make these jeans
mind-blowingly soft and flexible. And when I say flexible, I mean these jeans are so stretchy you could hit
the squat rack in them, no problem. They're so comfortable, they make basic movements like
sitting, bending, and kneeling feel like a dream. No exaggeration, you want to sleep in these jeans.
And it is no exaggeration, they are super comfy. And even better, Muggsy's jeans come in a stylish
fit that's not too baggy, not too tight, so you somehow look even better than you feel.
Men's Health called Mugsy jeans the best jeans for athletes for good reason.
Take our word for it.
Give Mugsy jeans a try and you won't be able to wear any other jeans again.
Mugsy is so confident you'll love their jeans, they do free shipping and returns,
so your comfort is 100 guaranteed.

That's a beer on us and a pair of the most comfortable men's jeans ever made
by heading to Muggsy.com using the promo code SPIT.
Biz, you've got to let us know when the Yotes are going on the dad's trip
next time.
They won Tuesday night in Vegas because we found out the Blues have gone
7-1 on their last couple of dad trips where the dads go along with them.
Well, their last eight.
Yeah, 7-1 last eight.
I just did the quick math for you there.
All right.
Thanks, brother.
Well, the Yotes, they had their dads.
They played Tuesday.
They smoked Vegas in Vegas.
That's some intel the gambling community
needs to get to.
We'll get to that a little bit more later. I thought the guy
was like, yeah, I put him right behind
the wheel and said, yes.
Guys, I was a little nervous. I know
my father wouldn't drink and drive, and I'm like, oh
God.
But Yoli took care of him.
Yeah. Thankfully, your mom was there to drive him.
I got a little scared there, too.
We don't want to be publicizing drunk driving stories.
A few other notes around the league we want to catch the listeners up on.
Bruin sniper David Pasternak, he's going to be out at least two weeks.
He was at a team function Sunday night.
He slipped, ironically, on some ice, I guess.
He had an injury to his thumb that required surgery,
so they're going to miss him for at least two weeks down the stretch.
Not ideal for a team that struggles to score.
He's had a team function.
I know everybody chirping online, oh, what was he,
buckled or blah, blah, blah.
It's like, well, if he was with the team,
I can't imagine he was fucking legless.
What do you think of that?
I mean, people just kind of reckless making allegations out there or what?
Well, I understand it can look like you're shit-faced,
you're out having time with your boys and something happens,
but everyone's saying for sure.
I mean, dude, how do you know he didn't just walk down
on his icy night, he steps on some ice, hurts his thumb.
I mean, we're not going to sit here and kind of guess
as to what happened or what him and his teammates were doing.
We don't know. Nobody knows.
I mean, I just think it's kind of ridiculous for everyone
to right away say he was shit-faced.
I mean, just because it's at night doesn't mean anything.
I have no opinion on it.
I didn't even know it happened, to be honest.
So, heal up there, Pasta, which is another guy that we got
at the All-Star game, and he was awesome.
He's got a great personality.
He's funny with that chip tooth
kind of pose it off yeah he's got a double christmas uh speaking of injuries too we did
mention the previous show james neal he got a puck off the teeth he ended up losing eight teeth
altogether uh but it turns out he lost even more teeth before that it was either i think 13 biz
had written in the text uh it might have been 11 teeth. We read contradictory reports.
Either way, he lost more than 10 fucking teeth in an incident before that.
I dug around.
I wasn't sure exactly how it happened,
but what's the most teeth you've ever lost, biz, in one sitting?
I have a bridge in my front grill here, so I lost one big tooth.
I actually got some dental work coming up.
Actually, I lost one on the side there, if you want to take a look there.
Oh, you never replaced?
It's got a little metal peg, so I got the replacement coming in in a couple weeks here.
But dental work sucks.
You got to go there, get frozen up, and all that drilling, just the noise of it.
We're talking about one here.
I couldn't imagine losing 11 or 13 teeth, man.
That's a full day at the dentist
and and now he's got to go through that again so uh thoughts out to james neal and uh he uh
he needs he needs uh our loving yeah i guess teammates were joking that they needed subtitles
for him because he can't understand him missing all those chiclets uh i got a feeling we'll be
talking about this guy with more updates as the show goes on.
Joe Thornton, we mentioned he had tied Gordie Howe for all-time assists.
Well, he passed him Monday night in Vancouver.
And at the same time he passed Gordie Howe for assists,
he tied Team Mussolini for number 15 in all-time points.
So big Joe Thornton just keeps chugging along.
I'm sure he's going to take another couple names down on the list as he keeps playing.
Some tough news out of Minnesota.
Tom Curvis, the Minnesota's 56-year-old assistant general manager.
He's also the GM of the Iowa Wild, their farm team.
He announced he has lung cancer.
There's a very well-done piece in The Athletic by Michael Russo, if you want to read it.
It kind of gets into the story of what happened.
Basically, he wasn't feeling well.
He had the team doctor check him out a couple different times.
They finally did a CAT scan. They found a mass on his lung. He has cancer on his
lung. So he's going to be fighting through it. He's got some medication. He's going to start.
They termed it basically stage three. And he did have a quote at the end of the story I thought
was good to share. He said, quote, everybody has a story. This is now part of my story. I hope it's
a happy ending. I plan on it being so,
end quote. So we echo those sentiments of Tom as well. We hope he gets through this as good as he
can. Cancer's a battle we're all familiar with. Everybody has friends, relatives who battle it,
and we hate to hear this news, but we want to send our best wishes and well regards to Tom
in his fight. Awesome guy. Todd Walsh introduced me to him, and he's always up in the press box,
just always has a smile on, and I wish him the best.
He's an unbelievable person.
Yeah, hockey community is tight and, you know,
really kind of gets around these stories and kind of gets behind guys.
So best wishes to him.
We're thinking of you.
Okay, well said, boys.
Oh, I got a question.
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day, so when this comes out, it's Valentine's Day.
Whit, what are you getting your old lady for Valentine's Day?
Probably nothing.
Valentine's Day is a scam.
I'll probably get her some flowers.
She doesn't like roses, and then a card.
But listen, that's a made-up holiday.
It's made up by Hallmark to just sell.
It's just genius.
They made up a holiday, and they make millions and millions off of it. It's nothing. I mean, yeah. Time out. Hold on. If you go out
and get your wife something really nice, nothing against that. But you know what I mean? I will
say this. So many couples with the Valentine's Day post on Instagram last year at the end of the day,
one of my buddies in our group chat, he said, guys, I'm very proud of all of us. Not one of
us did a Valentine's Day Instagram. Like, fuck your birthday, special days, any chat, he said, guys, I'm very proud of all of us. Not one of us did a
Valentine's Day Instagram. Like, fuck your birthday, special days, any day, you know,
you want to post something with your wife, your girl. Good for you. But to do it just because
it's Valentine's Day. Fuck off. Well, I was going to ask Hallmark created Valentine's Day.
I've always been told that maybe it's a complete wives tale, but what is it? I don't know.
Is it a legit,
like,
what is it already?
You know,
it's just a racket like St.
Valentine.
I mean,
what if not everyone's a fucking Catholic or a Christian who celebrates the saints?
I think it,
I think it was dummied up.
I don't know if it was a drummed up rather.
I don't know if it was by Hallmark,
but yeah,
it's not a real holiday.
Me and my old lady.
I mean,
when we first date,
we went on a couple restaurant dates and you feel like you're in a fucking
cafeteria. They're just shuttling you in, shuttling you out. So a couple of years in, I mean, when we were on our first date, we went on a couple restaurant dates, and you feel like you're in a fucking cafeteria.
They're just shuttling you in, shuttling you out.
So a couple years in, I says, look, fuck these dinners.
Like, we made an agreement.
Like, lobsters are red every Valentine's Day.
We get a couple lobsters.
We may have a big lobster dinner at home,
and then fucking don't have to go around messing around.
It works.
Now that we've been doing it for about 10 years now,
I don't think it's sucking.
I couldn't have guessed it, but it doesn't surprise me.
That is just perfect. They look like a hot. Hey don't think it sucked. I couldn't have guessed it, but it doesn't surprise me.
That is just perfect. They look like a hot.
Honey, you can hear them screaming as they're getting
boiled. Come on down.
Kind of hot.
I actually sent my ex flowers,
but only because we got that
1-800-Flowers promo, and I had one of the
guys from the office send them over.
I don't even think they sell flowers in
Secaucus.
I'm going to have to get on this.
So I sent it to my ex.
I said, from your favorite side piece, Paul.
I'll be expecting a call tomorrow.
Yeah, no shit.
How about a little gambling corner?
Jazz things up a little bit.
I didn't have one the last couple.
I got ice cold, man, after I hit that Edelman bomb.
I saw a tweet where you even mentioned I'm cold to somebody.
It happens.
Yeah.
A lot.
I had a good little comeback over the weekend, Sunday into Monday.
A couple of unposted plays, but they got me back on the swing of things.
So let's go.
Let's go to the gambling corner.
Thursday night, tonight, Calgary is at Florida.
Calgary got dusted by Tampa the other night.
I think they're going to come back with a strong effort.
So I like the Flames on the money line for a unit and the puck line for a half unit.
That's again Thursday, tonight in Calgary at Florida.
And then I got a couple of games Saturday.
The Bruins are at the Kings.
I like the Bruins on the money line for one unit and on the puck line for a half unit.
Also Saturday, Toronto is at Arizona. Sorry, Biz, I got to go against your boys. I like the Maple Leafs for one unit and on the puck line for a half a unit. Also Saturday, Toronto is at Arizona.
Sorry, Biz, I got to go against your boys.
I like the Maple Leafs for a unit and a puck line also for a half unit.
So once again, Calgary on Thursday night, money line for a unit,
puck line, half unit, and two games on Saturday, Boston and Toronto,
both on the money line for a unit, both on the puck line for a half unit.
Happy gaming.
Good luck to everybody.
Nice. Oh, I got a question.. Happy gaming. Good luck to everybody. Nice.
Oh, I got a question.
The Kings haven't been playing bad either.
After the travel out west, that's a ballsy one.
You mean where they went out east?
You mean the Kings?
The Kings just have been playing better overall lately,
and, you know, Bruins got a long flight.
But, I mean, I was just kind of just thinking about his picks.
The other two, I really
I think I
understood it because the Kings were just out east
they were playing and that's kind of when they got some
steam going. They've been playing some decent hockey
as you mentioned. Did you guys see
that pass from Elias Peterson
in that game against San Jose?
He is fucking insane.
To me,
if he continues what he's doing right now,
he's a top 20 player in the league.
He takes over games.
He's incredible.
He's dominating playing center in the NHL.
He wasn't even playing center last year in the Swedish League.
He was playing wing.
He is doing things that are just shocking people every night.
That play, he just slowed the game down a little bit,
pulled up a little head fake to open up a seam that nobody else would see.
And he just fires it over.
Just an incredible dish.
Actually, it was funny.
I don't remember the D-man playing it, but he played it kind of poorly.
He got turned towards the boards, got faked out a little.
And someone's like, look at this Whitney impression by so-and-so, the right D.
But it was just filthy.
I mean, he makes guys look stupid.
His shots also, I mean, he makes guys look stupid. His shots also,
I mean, he has a cannon. Hey, guys, real quick, just want to talk to you for a second about
state and liberty. Guys, there is nothing worse than guys that don't wear clothes that fit.
Trust me, I know better than anyone, especially where they are in shape and you have no way of
telling because they're wearing clothes that are too big. Well, guys, if you have an athletic
build and have struggled to find a dress shirt that fits, we have to tell you about State and Liberty. State and Liberty is known for making the best

Boys, I need the backstory on this junior kid getting just
shoved around and then somebody pokes at the back of his legs get bullied and then the announcer
obviously chimes in it was in the western hockey league you posted the video of the chicklets
account what how why was this kid getting bullied like that on the ice actually i poked around because
it was actually the western states hockey league not the, not the WHL. So there wasn't the coverage that you would get for the WHL.
So I didn't have any luck trying to track down the story.
I mean, it could be on some message board somewhere.
But, yeah, in case you missed the video on Instagram,
the little guy, they were doing the handshake line.
He's kind of sandwiched between two guys.
One guy pops his helmet off, and the other guy just fucking bitches him,
just trips him right outside the line.
I mean, tough video for the little guy to have to float around and go viral for man oh so oh so we don't
know the story to it but i felt bad for him and that was in the handshake line no no it was during
a stopped play there was a commotion a little over on the ice what is the western state hockey league it's a junior league uh sphl of
junior leagues yeah i mean what is that you can be 14 to 24 it's a 10-year gap you can play in the
oh one thing that we got to mention is i forget who the the guy's name is when you might remember
in pittsburgh he does the in between the periods and potash potash did you see him interview the guy between periods and like start hitting him on the head
when he was talking about how he's in it mentally yeah that was to my boy garrett wilson um yeah
potash just be just kind of telling him not to wake up but i mean you don't often see those guys
give the players uh pats on the head willie's just standing there like oh what's going on right now
but either way potash also dressed up i think for 80s night he was entering interviewing mike
sullivan with like black lips i was like this is ridiculous oh yeah he was just his kiss wasn't he
yeah i was just so funny sullivan was like answering serious questions yeah uh boys another
question i had for you did you guys see the unfair puck drop in overtime that johansson was
complaining about against st louis when tarasenko scored his Patrick goal uh and then they ended up sweeping
that home and home series uh Johansson was uh was not very happy about it uh you know he had some
some comments afterward obviously everyone started sending him like crying baby pictures on Twitter
and shit uh after that but uh just uh you know, wants more consistency as far as the puck drop
because that possession is huge three-on-three overtime,
and they ended up losing it, and they ended up getting scored on.
Quick question, Biz.
He did say, I just want it to be fair.
My stick wasn't even on the ice.
Now, can linesmen give themselves a mulligan there?
If they know they did an unfair drop, can they blow the whistle right away
and just say, hey, I'm going to do a do-over?
That wasn't like similar in basketball if the referee butchers a jump ball.
They can do it over right in the spot.
Can linesmen do a mulligan like that?
I don't know if that's wit.
I would assume that it's an actual referee's job to pay attention,
and if it's unfair, he were to blow it.
I'm pretty sure that that happens.
I don't think it's an issue if you drop it and then there's a quick whistle.
Yeah, that's a great question.
It makes sense that it would be that that's like almost the referee's job
to come in and kind of separate two guys trying to get space on the hash mark.
Maybe the same type thing for the puck drop, but good question, R.A.
Yeah, I'm sure we'll get answered by a linesman who follows our Twitter account.
A ref on the show someday.
Yeah, we're going to.
I got an in to that.
Oh, you too.
I think we should wrap up with Hockey Hall of Famer Eric Lindros.
He was supporting Ken Dryden's call for the NHL to penalize all hits to the head.
You had a little bit more info on that, R.A.
Yeah, Lindros was on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, let's see, last Wednesday, a week ago today. He
was urging the MPs, which I believe are the Canadian congressmen, to, quote, develop a
single national protocol for preventing and treating sports-related concussions, end quote.
He thinks that kids should take a few months off each year from sports like football and
hockey and give their brains a rest, basically.
He also supports Ken Dryden's call that all hits to the head should be penalized,
which means incidental ones,
and that body checking should be banned until after puberty.
I obviously understand what he's doing.
His career was cut short because of concussions,
but I think the issue is, and I've heard Dryden say it,
any hits to the head has to get a guy thrown out of the game.
I just think in hockey that there's just so much incidental contact
and accidental hits to the head that you'd be throwing half the guys
on teams out just because of accidental hits to the head.
What's your take on it, Biz?
The biggest question mark I have is when do you start contact for kids?
Is it a case of where you want them to learn how to do
it properly at a young age because if you wait too long then you know kids are bigger faster
stronger and then learning it for the first time where you might have more issues i don't know the
answer that a study would have to be done and that's there's a lot of people are going to have
varying opinions um i i went to a body contact hockey school when i was younger and that's where i learned how to
hit and and it helped me out drastically it was basically a full week of doing drills where you're
playing with the puck and guys are learning how to learning how to take hits and learning how to
give them so what what do you think when do you think they should start implementing contact in
hockey i don't know it's a tough tough question i grew up from like right away i mean well if you So, Whit, what do you think? When do you think they should start implementing contact in hockey?
I don't know.
It's a tough, tough question.
I grew up from like right away.
I mean, well, if you played like travel hockey, metro hockey,
I think it was called in Boston, there was hitting,
but town there wasn't at a certain age. That was later.
I mean, you make a good kind of a good argument for both.
I like, I'd like to see how it plays out right now with what they did in waiting a little longer.
I'm not sure the exact age. I wish I did. Grinnelli, I don't know if you knew, is it like 11 years old
now? Yeah, that sounds right. Either way, it's older. They make kids wait a little bit,
which I'd like to see. I'd just like to see that play out. But I also think, I mean,
if you really don't want your kids to play hockey, don't have them play hockey.
I mean, it's like you can talk all you want about how certain people hate how physical it is or how there's too much head contact or whatever the question is.
But in the end, it's up to you if you want to allow your kids to play.
If you don't feel comfortable, I don't know, they're not going to play.
At some point, but I shouldn't say at some point,
you're always going to have people that aren't happy with what's going on
and want something changed.
So it's up to the parents to figure out if they want to allow their kid to play.
And if they do, then you try to teach them the best way that you can
in terms of like how to take a hit, how to give a hit.
How to give a hit is probably just as important as how to take a hit,
to be honest with you.
Yeah, so we'll see what happens here.
I mean, these laws, they take time to pass.
And the thing with the age, too, is so many kids are different sizes at an age.
So even if you have a limit of 15 to 16, some guys haven't even hit puberty yet,
and other guys are fucking built like they're 24 years old.
So it's tough with the age.
Yeah, I had a bush when I was 12.
Like some of the kids in the school, their dicks hadn't even popped out yet.
My dick still hasn't even popped out yet.
Hey, I would hold court about telling guys
I was getting hand jobs and shit. They couldn't believe it
in grade 6.
Here's a weird one for you.
I got caught having a 69 by my
old man when I was going into grade
8. So it was the summer
of just finishing grade 7.
This girl was on probation.
She stole her neighbor's mail
she had to actually call her mom to come over
at that point there was no
anklets
I think I was wearing tighty whiteys going into 8th grade
you were 69 and chicks
was dad mad or was he proud
he was
he like called me
out of the room and then he's like
why are your eyes red we had smoking dope in there and then he's like, why are your eyes red?
He said, we got smoking dope in there.
And then he asked me if we were going to have sex,
and I was like, no, man, no.
He's like, I'm trying, Dad.
Fuck you.
Get out of my car right now.
I was going to, you cock block.
Oh, man.
