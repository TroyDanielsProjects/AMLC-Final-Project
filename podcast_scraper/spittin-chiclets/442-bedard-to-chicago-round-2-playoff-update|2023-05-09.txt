Hello everybody, welcome to episode 442 of Spittin' Chicklets, presented by Pink Whitney from our friends at New Amsterdam Vodka here in the Barstool Sports Podcast family.
We are back in Atlanta biz for another interview with the Hall of Famer.
We'll get to that a little bit shortly, but I've got to say hi to the crew.
It's been a minute since we've all been together.
Producer Mikey Grinelli, I haven't seen you in a couple of days
since London, Ontario.
How you been, buddy?
Guys, I might be all in on the OHL.
Oh, shocker.
I fell in love.
I fell in love.
You were all in on college hockey a month ago.
We need a prospects guy.
That can be me.
It was incredible.
It was unbelievable.
What other adjectives are you going to use to describe?
It was amazing.
Unreal.
The top five city in Canada as Columbus is in the U.S.
It was wild.
The hunters are now sending them wire, so they've now bought you.
What type of role do you have with this London Knights team now?
You were for sale?
Oh, I said right away that my fandom can be bought here.
A hundred percent.
There's no team in Boston.
My fandom can be bought.
There's no OHL team in Boston?
No.
Why don't you explain to everyone what you guys were doing up there? Yeah. So RA and I went up to London this past weekend.
We hung out with Mimsy, but we were there for some Make-A-Wish stuff. So we were,
we played in a ball hockey tournament that Hockey Fest was running by Jonesy.
So we were, we were basically auctioned off. So RA was auctioned off as a coach. I was auctioned
off as a player. These teams bought us and the money went to, I believe,
make the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
And, you know, we met a ton of kids, met a ton of fans.
We were there with Doug Gilmore and Curtis Joseph.
So RA in between the Leafs game,
in between the first and second period,
RA and I did a intermission panel with Doug Gilmore
and Curtis Joseph for the Leafs.
It was kind of like, what the fuck am I doing up here?
How many people asked RA questions as opposed to Gilmore?
We had to plant questions.
So everything was Leafs.
And I saw a memesy there.
And I'm texting him.
I'm like, go get Rick and have him ask us a question.
Because why?
Because RA was just up there just like scratching his head,
not getting asked any questions.
Well, both of us, we were kind of just sitting there like,
hey, so we're up here too.
But we understood.
I think we need to let people know.
You said Jonesy.
So Jonesy is the guy who helps us organize our ball hockey tournaments.
Obviously, there's an element to the barstool side in which helps us,
like live event Lisa, the whole crew.
There's like a million people we could list off.
But he's the one who, him and his squad set up the referees, the nets, the boards,
the whole kit and caboodle.
So he throws these other hockey fests around Canada to do good by either
charity or for people who, other people who want to host.
Yeah. And the cool thing is too, is it's, I mean,
our Chicklets Cup are 21 plus, his are all ages.
So you have little kids, you have, you know, the youth hockey going.
So it was, it was really cool.
Tons of Chicklets merch from younger kids, which was kind of wild to see,
but it was an unreal weekend. London is an amazing city.
The women are incredible.
What is the school there, Biz?
Western.
Western University.
Probably the craziest party school in all of Canada.
Really?
I think even when compared against American universities,
it would probably rank in the top 10 in North America.
Come on.
Wait, wait. Have you heard of the SEC no but as far as right party culture like uh like how good the city is in
general how many kids go there you know i would probably say there's a 40 to 50 000 students
all right that's fair enough they also have like a top tier business school which i went there and
did like a panel with before if you just said you went to business school no no this explains a lot everyone's talking about that he's doing anything
but he's like a business we're not bringing this guy back 45 45 000 they're like oh you know what's
your creative process i'm like i don't know like i smoke and then i just like text jeff and then
like all of a sudden i have this great great idea, man. And then Witt's like, no.
Pretty much.
All right, so you were getting used to it. Guys, it's so nice to record in person.
Oh, it's so much fun.
I know.
I know.
People probably listen.
And you'll just get a better vibe when we're all together.
It's nice.
It's not that often we get to do this.
So sorry to interrupt you.
Oh, no, no.
I agree.
But Ari, you were auctioned off.
And then on the way home.
So you've been getting used and abused in many regards uh you had an incident flying home and
you're you were pretty hot coming in about it you sent a huge text to the group chat can you tell
the fans what happened yeah uh basically diddled by tsa once again like i fly a lot i know the
drill i never have i don't even have a napkin in my pocket when i do the thing you're gonna put
your arms up no i stash them all in my bag when i put them in the metal yes folks he has handkerchiefs to wipe his forehead
and his yeah where i may be sweating or whatever so i i go through and um you know you can see your
your body's image there and there's like down on my groin it was like lit up red i was already
now and they're like oh we gotta pack it down i was like i was like what why it goes can i just
like like i'm but my pants somewhere private just like like no we have to and they literally like put the back of their hand
when you say they it was it was a i'm sorry the tsa agent one guy and listen this isn't all of
them we've i've talked to all these folks over the years they're good folks we've had fans who
listen to the show and stuff but this one guy he tells you like basically i'm gonna make contact
with your genitals with the back of my hand and like you bristle backwards like i felt so fucking violated so i said to the the the girl her partner i says
what causes this thing to come up on my junk that you have to do this she said well you have baggy
shorts on i'm saying i says so you're telling me because i have baggy clothes on that i gotta have
to get degraded like this she's like basically i was like it's fucking humiliating i thought
there was the one you go through you can go through the one that's just nothing.
And then you go through the one where you put the arms up.
Right.
So you can't choose to go through the second one if the first one has something pop up.
Like, they have to feel you.
I went to the one where you put your arms up.
That's the only one I had the option for, which I don't mind because I didn't think.
How many times?
I've never.
Have you?
I've never been touched.
Never once.
I think like once or twice.
And yeah, like you said, it's a little bit uncomfortable but like if a guy like one if he has to do it i understand i don't
want to like kick dust up but if he wants to graze his head and knuckles across my ball sack it's
like go ahead dude like paying to do it you ain't getting on the inside yeah you can i'll keep them
boxed out outside my house we're going hockey terminology here but if they want to go over my my reigning champ sweat pant joggers feel free
buddy i'll even hey i'll even give him a fucking wink while he does it just to get him going
whisper sweet nothing's in his ear as he's backhanding your horn we're traveling for the
cup finals i'm getting tugged off by a guy tsa asian i'm like there's our flight leaves in five
minutes i only need 20 seconds hey um what was i just gonna ask you i'm like put a little lube
on there they got the hand sanitizer i'm like oh it's dried up do you think this has something to
do with you being on a list after the drug incident at customs that time because i'm
wondering no that would cut that was Customs.
Customs and TSC.
I know, but maybe then
your name and picture
actually goes on
like a list.
It has nothing to do with that.
It's literally
when I went through the thing,
like if you have something
in your hood,
they might check your hood
or whatever.
I had nothing in my pants.
Obviously, I'm not going
to fly with shit
anywhere you're going.
Very fidgety, though.
I can see why
they'd pick you on a line.
You're very, very...
It's like a 40-person line.
Look at that guy.
He's already getting nervous.
He's tweaking.
Meanwhile, he's just like
writing the outline for the pod.
He's like, ah!
I'm like Clooney in Out of Sight.
I'm a professional flyer.
I know how to get it all done.
It's fucking literally...
I fly frequently enough to know,
no, this has nothing to do with that.
They fucking thing...
They told me because my shorts were baggy.
That's why the thing popped up
and that's why they had a fucking molester. I to get a dm saying hey i've seen ra flying and
is this guy ever a sketch line in the tsa now when you talk about these uh tsa pat downs in
these situations that you seem to always find yourself in every single time you fly like every
time you fly we have a story how many dms do you get from people being like, hey, I had a fucking TSA agent trying to tug me off too?
Well, we'll find out after this episode drops, I guess.
I'm not sure we talked about the last one,
but let's go back to London, man.
I don't want to talk about getting fucking diddled by TSA.
Oh, okay.
One of the guys I coached, and I say coached in quotes this week,
he told me that Weston made the Playboy top 10
for hottest girls at a potty school way back in the day.
I mean, it's obviously still pretty prevalent.
Okay, so I take back my mind.
I was looking for some prom dates.
Also busy.
It might have been a little BDS recruitment trip as well, too.
I don't know what the roster is looking up for the next one,
whenever it may be.
But a couple of these dudes with studs and their teammates are like,
hey, if BDS is looking for some guys,
the kid with the mullet there with the glasses.
Entertaining as hell, too.
Yeah, Biz is going to get cut.
So that's the problem with this.
No, I'm not.
Biz is the weak link.
No. But he's the GM, hell, too. Yeah, Biz is going to get cut, so that's the problem with this. No, I'm not. Biz is the weak link, but he's the GM, owner, and president,
so he's basically like Putin who puts himself on the Russian national team
and then can't even skate.
I don't know how many people listening haven't seen those clips of Putin
basically putting him first line in these celebrity games.
And the goalie just being like, oh, you got me there, Vladimir.
Yeah, him and Kim Jong-un going
head-to-head at it um so you you abbreviated the the big deal selects and that's the ball hockey
team I feel like considering we mentioned Jonesy we should mention we're very we're very close to
deciding the next location one yard line we're at the one yard we're at the one yard line uh we have
a couple cities in mind and we're looking forward to announcing that we also have some other big announcements i think we should
start with that as well the fact that why we're here all right yeah uh hopefully pete cowell isn't
coaching if we're at the one i know seriously we've been at the one for about a year so sean
lynch was just chomping at the bit and we have another super bowl thank god for that horrible
call best moment of my life. Brutal, brutal.
Sandbagger, next week, May 17th,
Raichi El Presidente and Josh Richard versus these two guys.
That is correct.
I haven't seen it yet.
Pasha sent me over a copy late last night.
I'm going to watch it tomorrow in the flight home.
All I remember is Dave complaining.
I'm going to say when we teed off 39 degrees and blowing 40 miles an hour and and
after that i don't really remember much of the comments but i'm sure once once once i see the
first cut pasha crushed it again that'll be a good one to describe it i'd say it's the complete
opposite of the posture knock one where it was good vibes everyone's having fun light-hearted
this one it's just pure anger throughout the entire thing yeah
a lot of hatred hatred along with 50 mile wins and what is described as the worst day of dave
portnoy's life so which made it the best day the best dave portnoy fan come and have a few chuckles
as uh as we drag him through this horrific day and the reason why we're in atlanta ra a huge
announcement another hall of famer coming on the podcast, but
not a hockey player.
A sick league Hall of Famer.
A sick league Hall of Famer, the round
mound of rebound himself, Charles
Barkley. We're going to be chatting with him soon. Can't wait
to do this, man. One of my favorite players growing up. My
father's probably favorite non-Celtic
growing up. Everyone in my neighborhood loved
Charles Barkley, except my mother, who for some
reason never heard of him.
But I can't wait to chat with him.
It's going to be a huge thrill.
I'm still a huge hoops guy, but back in the day, man,
loved Barkley watching him play.
So I wasn't watching much basketball back then.
How would you describe his game?
I mean, I know he was an incredible Hall of Famer.
He did it all, scoring, passing, rebounding,
kind of like maybe a second version of Magic, but maybe not to that level. Yeah, I mean, he didn't a, maybe like a second version of magic,
but maybe not to that level. Yeah. I mean, he didn't pass like magic. He was sort of a bulldog
all day. He would just bury, you know, make his room underneath. He wasn't the tallest guy,
but he could grab a bunch of rebounds. He was probably like a, if I had to get, I don't know,
25, 10, 25.10 rebound guy, 11 rebound guy without memorizing the stats. He was a beast.
Perennial all-star, hall of fame. I mean, he got to I think at least one final,
maybe two, because I know he got there with Phoenix in
93. Jordan beat him that year, and he might have got back with
Houston as well. But just, I mean,
fucking unreal player. And of course, the personality.
Oh, my God. He's the best. He's uncancelled.
Yeah, so I saw the clip of
you went on his podcast. Called The Steam Room.
Great name. And it was him
and Ernie Johnson who does, like, Liam McHugh's
job for NBA and and tnt but
fill everyone in on the first time you saw him or met him it was in that steam room right yeah so i
obviously started the show with tnt last year and you know we've grown to known each other a little
bit and you know he works out at the same gym because he lives here and uh and just when i
went down there i didn't know that he was the guy in the steam room. So I go for steams and saunas usually every day.
And I go in there and I can notice that there's a guy on the top shelf of the steam room doing
crunches.
And he's a big guy.
But I didn't know it was Charles.
So I kind of sit in the corner of the sauna to avoid any type of contact or making even
eye contact with this guy on the top shelf doing crunches.
And after he was done
his crunches, he just like came down and he's like, Hey, is that biz? And I'm like, Oh, Charles.
And like, he's just, you know, he's obviously spread Eagle and he's got this, what looks like
a hand towel around him, but it's a beach towel. And it was just kind of a funny interaction. And
I just thought it was funny at the fact that he invited me on his podcast and it's called the
steam room. I go, did you come up with a name after our interaction?
But he actually had another crazy interaction with a guy in a steam room as
to how it came to be, but I'm super excited to get him on.
I know that he's very, uh, he he's, um, he's very complimentary of Canada.
Like he loves Canada and we have so many Canadian listeners.
So I'm interested to hear what, what he loves so much about Canada,
probably other than the women.
Cause he seems to always compliment the women in Canada,
especially Toronto.
And just like, I would probably put him as top 25
most recognizable people in North America.
Like, is there anybody who doesn't know?
It's an interesting point to go with 25.
I mean, I feel like everyone does know who Chuck is, though.
He's just such a recognizable guy where, you know,
his basketball career was his basketball career,
but I would say most people know him for being on television and just being
this funny guy who,
who's in the media world.
40 years now,
he's been part of,
you know,
part of pop culture between hoops and TV and whatnot.
So it's going to be a great time.
I can't wait for it before we get to the pucks.
Wait,
and that,
and that interview is going to drop next Tuesday.
So that,
that interview will be on the Chicklets YouTube and Spotify app.
So you guys got a lot of treats coming towards you. You got a Barkley
interview on Chicklets for next Tuesday's drop
and then Wednesday's Sandbagger.
And then as we said, Chicklets Cup, they're
coming very soon. So we got a lot on deck, folks.
Absolutely. We'll get to the hockey in one sec.
Just a couple of thank yous from London for me
and G. Thanks to Lucy's, Joe
Cool's, Burger Burger, the Londonites, and
Jonesy. Everybody up there took terrific care of us.
It was great having a celebratory beer,
beer with Dale Hunter in the coach's room after the game.
If you told me that in 1987,
you're going to be drinking a beer with the guy
who just beat up your fucking team.
I don't want to laugh in your face, but it was good stuff.
I think we're going to make some Canada trips this summer, though.
Everyone talks about how amazing Canada is to go to in the summer.
Everyone kept talking about Grand Bend.
I've never heard of this place.
Yeah, I used to go there.
Oh, fuck. That's where we used to go chase the ladies summer. Everyone kept talking about Grand Bend. I've never heard of this place. Yeah, I used to go there. Oh, fuck.
That's where I used to go chase the ladies.
Yeah, usually all the people from London
head there to the beach.
It was a good little town.
Okay, just quickly back to the London Knights game, though.
They're off to the what?
The OHL Finals?
OHL Finals.
North Bay Battalion?
Yep.
Okay, so how was the game?
RA, you got to go in the room afterward,
celebrate with the boys?
Yeah, I didn't know that was coming. I just wanted to meet Dale because I was texting Big Walter was the game already you got to go in the room afterward celebrate with the boys yeah i didn't know that was coming i just wanted to meet dale because i was texting big walter on
the game he said make sure you go say hi to dale after the game and i thought we were going to pop
in and say how you're going then one of the pr guys to say all right come say hi to the boys
he's like go say something to him and i was like i didn't know you're in speech too they're like
speech speech i can't even talk right now you know i had ve Vegas voice bad by the end of the weekend.
But I just go, you know, Gabe, how about them London Knights?
And the fucking place blew up.
That's all you need, buddy.
That's all I needed.
So it was pretty cool for me.
10,000 people in that arena, though.
That is insane for a junior hockey game.
Yeah.
It was a great, great time.
Great trip.
I can't wait to get back up.
That will not be my last time at London, Ontario.
I can tell you that.
Before we continue, I need to talk about Pink Whitney.
The weather's turning. I keep saying it 70 degrees all week in Boston. The Pink Whitney
is flowing. Whether you like it with a little soda water, whether you like it on the rocks,
whether you like the nips, the little beautiful shots that we can do on the golf course, on the
beach, at the barbecue, doesn't matter. Anywhere you want to get your liquor,
you can get Pink Whitney. And I'm telling you right now, another little trick I've learned is
maybe even pour a shot into a beer. Does that sound crazy? Yes. Does it create a nice little
buzz? Yes. So anywhere you want, you can drink it, you can enjoy it. Doesn't even matter if it's
still very cold where you are. It always tastes good.
It always tastes fresh.
And whatever you mix it with, whatever you enjoy your vodka with, you'll enjoy it.
So get involved.
Get the nips flowing.
Get the big bottles.
Share them at the party.
Collect the bottles after.
Send me a picture.
I appreciate, as we appreciate, all your support.
Pink Whitney's where it's at.
Right now, Go get some
and have a drink and enjoy yourself. Pink Whitney for life. The big news tonight in the NHL Monday
night, the Chicago Blackhawks have won the Conor Bedard draft lottery. They're vastly speeding up
their rebuild. They last took first overall at 07 when they took Patrick Kane. This is either
going to put conspiracy theories to bed or start no one's.
But if Gary was going to rig it, this is probably going to be the one he would have rigged and not let Chicago win.
But what's your reaction?
What's a Chicago getting to die?
Would you say that?
Which I feel like the complete opposite.
We're talking about the, what, the second biggest market in the United States as far as population for hockey?
Second or third, I would say.
Or third, yeah.
I guess because just maybe snapping it around between
anaheim la and then and then san jose but as far as like density in the state of illinois
having an original six being an original six and i mean we should have known that they were
going to get it when we came out and said there's no chance they'll ever get it correct i believe
ra said once i don't know like with what's going on with the Blackhawks organization,
would they ever let it happen?
And I was like, yeah, you're probably right.
Well, sure as shit, the chicklets mush.
And next thing you know, Chicago gets it.
It was, I mean, they deserved it.
They were horrible, right?
I mean, it was one of the worst teams you've ever seen,
especially the second half.
They got rid of Kane, but what is it?
16 years later, right?
16 years later, they get the first overall again,
and apparently it's another generational talent.
So, I mean, what's interesting is, like,
it changes the entire future of the Chicago Blackhawks.
Like, you're looking at going in.
They were the third-ranked team in terms of odds to get it.
I believe it went Anaheim, Columbus, them.
And so you're wondering,
like the Blackhawks don't have anything going.
I don't know how long this is going to be.
I think Davidson came out and said it would be a five,
it's like a five-year plan.
And now everything just immediately switches.
And one of the things is that next year,
ideally they would be bad again
and he'd light it up and have a great rookie year.
And they're able to, I believe it's already been mentioned,
they sold 1. million dollars of season tickets since the announcement what three
hours ago so I know big cat texted me he got season tickets he's like well even if they're
bad for a couple years I can give them out to people and then when they're good I'll already
have the seasons but free agents all of a sudden that's what happens you get guys like I want to
go play there not only is it an awesome city with an amazing fan base and arena and history,
well, you have this young superstar.
So I guess there's always the question of, I've had people ask me,
is he going to be that good?
There's always a question and a wonder.
But I don't think anyone's been discussed at this length
since McDavid and Crosby, right?
Well, you made a good point this afternoon
you said usually when there's this much hype around a player they never end up disappointing
because the last time i would say that we've heard this much hype is definitely mcdavid maybe
matthews yeah matthews was a lot of hype as well i would say just another example i would say he's
doing good right now but also because he's canadian it's probably amplified a lot more because the the amount of hockey coverage that happens in canada compared
to the united states so but even even with matthews like i think that he lived up to every expectation
as being the first overall pick and how much hype but i think we have to go back to mcdavid and we
have to go back to crosby as a comparison where with a guy who's been pumped up this much, they've, there's never
really been a bust. Now I've talked to a lot of people and they don't seem to think that the game
will transfer over to the NHL side, to the degree saying that I would say that there's enough people
that I respect hockey opinion on where I don't know. I just assume this kid's fucking nasty.
You see the way, I think he's a great
skater. I think he's strong on his feet. I think he has one of the nastiest shots,
which we'll get to about how you said how it came to be on some feature that talked about him.
But I would say that the concern of his size, which I would push back and say, well, I feel
like the NHL these days is a little bit more built for small guys than it ever has been.
So his opportunity to succeed with the amount of power plays that are given
and how it's,
it's really amplifying the skill aspect of the sport.
I don't think that,
but I'm just interested to hear some people think that,
Hey,
I don't think this guy's going to pop off the way that people expect he is
where,
I mean,
I know,
I know we talked about Lafreniere last podcast about maybe how he played,
but there wasn't this type of hype surrounding him.
No, no, not at all.
So you have to, I guess, appreciate the hype
as to how high it is
and maybe what we think we're going to get out of this guy
based on that hype.
Yeah, my thing is he's so heads and shoulders
above the rest of the people his age
and the world junior records
and then the WHL and the first ever WHL.
Exemption.
Exemption.
Double underage.
Yeah, so it's like all these things come together where in my mind,
I'm like, I can't imagine him missing.
Emily Kaplan did a story on ESPN.
She went and interviewed him.
And Armdog, he went and did something for Sportsnet.
I haven't seen that.
I think that came out today.
But I watched the ESPN one with Emily, and McKinnon's on there saying he's got one of the best shots he's ever seen
and and McDavid's complimenting him so it's like if you're getting like discussion around you from
from your peers at that level like I don't I don't think these guys would just be saying that just to
say it like they've obviously seen him he was at the bio steel camp we've talked about uh but the
story about his shot which apparently is like the the best part of his game he can change angles it's just it's
just amazing strength well when he was so i think i think he was 12 or 13 he broke his right wrist
and um which is his lower hand he's a righty and i guess the doctor said listen like once they
looked at the x-ray like this is this, this is right around where the growth, what is it?
Growth spurts?
Yeah.
Growth plate.
Growth plate, whatever. Like, so this has to be taken like super seriously. This could really
affect like the entire growth of your hand and your arm as you grow up. So it was 12 weeks,
like don't touch a thing. And he goes on to say like, so I obviously took it very serious. His
dad's on this little story and, and said what he did is he's just like outside and he just starts shooting one-handed
where you know you get your leg behind it you're just flicking it like that you're trying to do it
on the backhand and you know three months of that well all of a sudden the cast comes off everything
healed correctly and something changed like whether it was the strength in his top hand
but his shot became that much better and that much more lethal,
even at that young of an age that his game has completely continued to evolve,
but his shot is his weapon.
And maybe because of that surgery,
he was lucky enough to have some sort of strength in his top hand
where it became like basically like unstoppable.
I mean, you saw this year over 70 goals.
It's crazy but the
the the thing that the thing that i think is like basically like you can't put up numbers like that
and have all these people talk about you the way like scouts are saying he's gonna get 100 points
next year i've heard on certain teams and and i just don't think that there's like the bust
material there based on the resume and how scouts are doing it
i don't think so either i was just kind of you know you talk to people there's a lot a lot yeah
there's way more talk with smarter hockey minds you spit it out biz smarter hockey minds than me
so i just try to siphon through the information and i guess i heard that from a few people and
i was surprised where i think that it all signs point to him being a superstar now going back to
that shot thing too it's like if you were want to have one weak wrist or hand that bottom hand is the one that you kind
of want just gliding pat over the stick right that like the tsa agent like the top one is the one
that you want the popeye wrist for the tug job so anyway no the other the other part of the story
that cracked me up is um you know, it was hockey every day.
It was his entire life.
He loved it.
Like his parents are talking about.
It's stuff you can't teach kids.
You could never have a kid do this.
For the drive aspect? Yeah, the drive.
Hyper-focused?
Yeah, you're just so into it all day, all night.
You're thinking about it.
And they went to Hawaii.
And he's like, I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.
So he's like, I got to bring all my stuff.
And so he brings his rollerblades, his gloves, and and like i guess he landed in hawaii and the people like we've never seen anyone show up to
hawaii with a hockey stick and their rollerblades and he just skated every day so the passion's
there um i'm very excited to see him in chicago i mean it's it's certainly now we'll go to the
broadcast of the draft that are trolling us now espn fumbled it and it wasn't Kevin Weeks' fault and it wasn't Bill
Daly's fault, but for whatever reason,
Columbus had a very good chance to get it.
Grinelli's been all over the Columbus train in terms of that being a great
spot. And if you look at like, he would have been with line and good roll.
Like that could be a place that he popped off immediately and that they could
have maybe been a playoff team even.
Well, they got through to the top three picks left and they're going to commercial.
And all of a sudden, without even saying anything or flipping over the envelope, Weeksie mentioned,
oh, Columbus Blue Jackets are now third.
So I think like he's not it's not him.
Like he's just like doing the broadcast.
And so at some point it got messed up to where what he said was he just said it's come down
to Anaheim and Chicago and just never mentioned Columbus.
So he basically threw Columbus out the door.
And he's like, Anaheim's never had a first round pick before in Chicago, hasn't had one since Patrick Kane.
And then just cut it on the run.
The B-roll. It was kind of like it was probably worse than when Steve Harvey announced the wrong.
The wrong guy. What was that?
It was winner of Miss America.
Miss America, I think.
But these poor Blue Jackets fans, there's like 500 people at a bar like looking to change the direction of their
entire no climax whatsoever they're just like wait what we we got we didn't even get second
they didn't even get to see their card well and then they came back and flipped over the columbus
card three so it was kind of a clusterfuck. Now, then what happened was, I guess I've been notified on Twitter by many people.
I was incorrect.
They showed up to the board
and it was Anaheim at one and Chicago at three.
And there was a star next to Chicago.
I was like, did they just give away
that Chicago got it?
And sure shit, they flip over in Chicago.
They put the envelope over.
Chicago has the first pick.
I guess what the star meant was that they won.
By them moving up, they won, and that's who gets stars.
So I guess other years, whatever teams end up moving up will have a star next to them.
I guess that didn't signify.
In grade school, when you washed your hands after you pissed or you did good on a project,
they gave you a star on the board.
Yeah, sort of.
I guess so.
Yeah, that's good.
If you wash your hands after you pee. Well, that's for the young kids. That guy almost dum yeah if you yeah that's good if you want if you wash
your hands after your pee that's well that guy almost dummied you for you're not doing it so
you never got a star but i i think in the end it was just the the the issue for blue jackets fans
they have the biggest like gripe i would guess and for people who's saying it's rigged i i
i don't think it's rigged i mean they're they're all there and the lottery ball
comes out and there's representation in the room there was reporters invited this year that
obviously like they take their phone away and they're not able to say anything on the payroll
yeah well who knows exactly but chicago to get him is is shocking just because they they they
had kane he's now gone and then they just get another guy to start this thing over again.
And for Anaheim fans, an enormous disappointment
after they lost out the Crosby sweepstakes
and ended up with the second pick in Bobby Ryan,
who had a great, great run in Anaheim.
But Anaheim fans, they're going to get Adam Fantilli.
So, you know, it's like that's also a game-breaker
with McTavish and Zegers and Drysdale.
So still a super bright future in Anaheim,
but they were that close to a true game-breaker
from what we're being told.
I guess my only comments would be,
obviously it's not rigged.
I was just poopy pants at the fact
that Arizona stayed at six.
Why don't they have the ball system there?
I feel like it's so much more fun to watch the ball.
Like, oh, you know,
and then obviously there's no questioning it.
Although when Patrick Hewing,
Hewing, Ewing? Ewing,wing ewing yeah the frozen envelope theory oh so that was an envelope i thought that the ball got stuck or something and then maybe that's why they don't do it no
betman would reach in other betman says what's his name david stern yeah they well they used
they did used to work together yeah they were pals they they would pull the out he would reach
in it was like a big giant ball and he would pull the envelope. He would reach in. It was like a big, giant ball, and he would pull the envelope up.
And the rumor was that they had frozen or made the Knicks envelope cold,
so when he reached in, he would feel it.
I mean, I think it's a total bullshit conspiracy theory.
They still talk about it.
Tinfoil hat.
It's hilarious.
I don't think this stuff is bullshit.
Send us your craziest draft theories of this year,
maybe even the past, folks.
Send them on over.
And the Knicks didn't even win a title either.
I know.
If they did.
But seriously, when are they going to put the bed,
like the size thing in the NHL?
They talk about it all the time.
There have been so many undersized guys who have killed it.
I mean, since going back to frigging the pocket rocket, Rashad.
I think it's important.
I mean, I think you see it a little bit even come playoff time
where when you're a smaller guy, sometimes the game doesn't transfer over when things come to push and shove and maybe things are aren't called as loosely
or I guess as tightly excuse me during the regular season like I know I'm maybe hopping forward a
little bit here I feel like you know Mitch Marner tends to get knocked off the puck a little bit
more than than maybe other guys yeah you know he's got amazing ability and he does other things
extremely well,
but you know, it's hard.
So you saw it with Jack Hughes a lot when he first came into the league too.
I think he was getting knocked off the puck all the time.
He was tall though, isn't he?
He looks tall on the ice.
Like when I'm standing next to him,
I'd say he's like an inch or two taller than me.
Probably like six feet.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would definitely put him at close to six feet
with for today's NHL standards
and probably with his size now
that he's grown into
his body is probably a normal size NHL or as they're looking more and more,
Oh,
breakaway for Vegas.
Who cares?
It was a stinker.
Yeah.
But Hey,
congrats to Chicago.
I mean,
they've,
you know,
they haven't gotten many bounces in the past,
so I think that they needed one.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Let's see.
Next up the Rangers and Gerard Gallant have parted ways.
They don't say fight anymore.
They said they parted ways.
He was there for two years, got the Rangers to the Eastern Conference Finals last year.
Of course, he got knocked out in the first round by Jersey this year.
Still had two years left on his deal.
As far as a replacement, I know Joel Quenwell was probably the first name that comes up,
but the league has still not reinstated the former Blackhawks coach.
And haven't they denied that?
I don't know.
They haven't really said what the process is.
Basically, Bettman has to approve it.
Like, I don't know what he has to do, what kind of penance he has to do.
And Stan Bowman is also in the same boat as Quenville.
He's not, like, he can't take a job right now willy-nilly.
He has to get approved by Bettman, which, again, I don't know what the parameters are.
So I also heard from a couple people that they were trying to do it in November.
So I also heard from a couple of people that they were trying to do it in November.
I heard they were trying to get trots in before he took the job with, why am I driving Nashville?
So I don't know.
Like there was definitely rumors of them looking into getting a new coach in
November and then everything switched around and the Rangers started playing
really good.
It was just like,
kind of,
I said this right after they lost I thought Galant
was going to get fired I don't think it's shocking by any means knowing like the owner of the the
Rangers and and and the expectations I mean he yeah like RA just said they were in the the the
Eastern Conference final last year and then this year it was just that much of a dud where time to
make a shake-up now there was rumors swirling that he went after Panarin during that first round, correct?
From what maybe just like, you know, in the locker room,
got frustrated saying, you know,
you said you were going to be better this year.
And I would say that probably, I mean,
Zibanejad did come on towards the end of the series,
but I would say the biggest letdown overall
had to have been Panarin's performance in playoffs.
I mean, the goaltending was there.
I thought that every D-man at some point brought something and was solid.
But I just think that he was non-existent early.
And then when they needed him the most, he just really wasn't there already.
Yeah, I mean, they have the two-nothing series lead, then they blow it.
It's just, oh, this is two years he's only been there.
We looked at Gallant's record.
He's always done like two and a half to three years with a team.
He didn't even get that third year with the Rangers.
I mean, now as far as who they're going to bring in business,
Pete Olaviolette, Chris Knobloch, he's the coach in AHL,
Andrew Burnett.
Who would you hire if you were going to hire him?
Well, just to go back, so I was asking people,
like what do you make of like going after a guy in the midst of a series
to challenge him?
Like I've played for coaches like that.
I don't hate it.
I don't hate it either.
Where obviously sometimes when you're dealing with Russianussian players sometimes they tend to shut it down and that's not just saying it's russians there's other guys who will shut it down too but it seems
to be more of a common theme with them um and then just also like maybe the the like he's more
of a raw raw guy but rather than like an X's and O's style coach.
They made no adjustments.
No adjustments throughout that round.
So I think that that probably ended up being
where they didn't see anything happen,
where it just came down to them having to let him go.
I mean, they got the bodies there.
They got the guys who can get the job done.
They just really didn't, like you said, make any adjustments.
They looked worse as the series went on.
But most of the fans, I'm sure, want to rip on the guys
who didn't get the job done.
Yeah, I mean, Panarin, he didn't get much done last year.
He had awful playoffs this year.
But I don't know.
They're not going to, what do they say?
You're going to fight one coach, you can't get rid of 25 guys.
But it is something, you know, there's something that goes on
where Gallant's message goes stale.
I mean, he's had success at all these spots.
And then, boom, it's not very long after having, like, good runs where he's he's had success at all these spots and then boom it's not very long after
having like good runs where he's let go so maybe it is the lack of adjustments and what you're
saying he's more of let's try harder we need more energy we need more um better conditioning things
like that as opposed to like our i think our system needs to change i don't know i've never
played for him but you almost feel bad in a sense of like the guy has like a pretty good coaching resume, but just gets let go pretty quick at each spot.
Yeah, no doubt. Who would you hire with? Any particular guy?
I don't know. I mean, Andrew Brunette, he was so good getting Florida to that legendary season.
Now they got waxed by Tampa. We went over that. And then, God, what has that done for this team this year now? You know, having that brutal kind of second round upset
they dealt with, but he's been great with Jersey.
So that's definitely an option.
But my thing is that if you look at the AHL success,
the guy, Chris Knobloch,
Chris, don't call me Chuck Knobloch.
He, for me, it's like,
when you're a part of the system already,
if you've been dealing with prospects, if you've been dealing with prospects,
if you've been dealing with training camp and you know what the team and the
GM expects and wants, I feel like you look towards the minors.
I mean, I know you go back to Pittsburgh days, they got Dan Bosma.
They won the Stanley cup. Like it's becoming more common.
Jay Woodcroft in Edmonton has done a great job.
He was coaching in the AHL.
I'm a firm believer that if you think you have a guy that guy that you trust and can do a good job at the next level, if he's already been in that system and been with you, why wouldn't you give him a chance?
Yeah, so that's where the age-old argument of why are people still recycling the same NHL coaches, but in the same breath, it's like, well, Lindy Ruff is a recycled coach, and he's up for the Jack Adams.
And, I mean, Montgomery has been around before.
I mean, I guess you would probably say he's been recycled given his age.
Probably a bad example.
But going to what you're saying, as far as giving these younger AHL guys a chance,
John Cooper is probably the best example.
You know, he was with them with the Norfolk Admirals,
a lot of those guys who, like, Palat, Killorn.
I want to say that Braden Point was even on that team
where in 2012, they won the Calder Cup.
Maybe it was a little later on than that.
I want to say it was 2012.
But I think that probably more of these younger guys
should get the opportunity
because they also know how to deal
with these new style of players
where they are a little bit more sensitive.
There's almost like just as much time
that needs to go in massaging the relationships and their emotions just as much as the x's and o's aspect so and
old school guys don't do great with that and i don't really blame them i mean you've you've been
set in your ways for so long it's just and these new age guys they've been coaching the younger
groups and they understand it's just different now i I got a couple of new age guys. I think they could hire Jay Leach with the Kraken.
Yeah.
His name comes up.
He's his name's come up a ton.
You guys mentioned AHL coaches,
Ryan Wersofsky.
He's with the Sharks this past season.
Friend.
Awesome guy.
He's done.
He might need a little more time.
I think about he won.
He won a championship in the East coast league as a head coach.
So that's,
that's having that pedigree of winning.
And then David Quinn brings him into San Jose.
Yeah. I could for sure see him a head coach. And then one more, that pedigree of winning and then david quinn brings him into san jose yeah i could for sure see him a head coach and then one more it's a bit of a wild card and i'd love to hear your take on this is jay pandolfo he was no he's at bu don't even talk about he was
assistant coach for the bruins for a long time i got a name for him and drury are really good
friends i think i got a i got a name for you guys mark Mark Messier. Just throw him right in the fire.
Sean has been saying that for a while.
I don't think you can.
Do you remember when Barry Melrose coached the Tampa Bay Lightning?
Like when you've been away from the game that long.
By the way, me putting Barry Melrose and Mark Messier in the same sentence,
that's not necessarily fair.
But he hasn't even been around.
You can't just hop in to be an nhl head
coach or can you yeah it was in the post and then like it's like either way it's a fucking headline
news it would be it would be a it would be a headline grabber that's for sure uh i just would
get worried about him uh is it david quinn yes so when he went there was that his first time ever
being an nhl head coach yes i feel with such
a historic franchise there's a lot of pressure on a guy who has no experience especially an
original six franchise where like they tried it in chicago with jeremy colleton it's just hard if
you've never been a head coach to all of a sudden take the head coaching job of a marquee franchise
i feel like the pressure the media and everything you got larry brooks asking you questions every fucking day that's why i'm all in on mark messier i don't
give a fuck about the experience nonsense get him in the mix i want to see how that would play out
better shot of seeing us both grow hair back me and mess than him getting that job i don't think
it's gonna happen no way uh should we should we prep biz we're about to talk about the toronto
maple leafs i just want to give you a little trigger warning. It's not over. It's not over.
Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?
You scrub.
All right.
After making the second round for the first time in nearly two decades,
the Toronto Maple Leafs will need to make some rare history
in order to see their first conference final since 2002.
They lost to Florida 3-2 in overtime on Sunday
to fall behind 3-0 in the series.
Sam Reinhardt's wraparound, three minutes into OT,
ended it, his fifth goal of the playoffs.
The Leafs hadn't lost three in a row since October.
They come out flying.
They had that 11-4 with 7-D lineup.
Come out flying.
They had two 2-1s the first two minutes, got the lead,
but then they just sort of fizzed out, only had four shots on goal
the rest of the first.
Then they lose that goal to Ilya Simsonov, 37 seconds into the second.
Luke Shen crashed into him.
Joseph Wall, I thought he played well.
You know, wasn't perfect, but biz, man.
Your team's down 3-0.
What's the story?
Are they going to come back?
A little nugget here before we get going.
Four teams all time have come back from 0-3 down.
I never heard that.
The 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs,
they actually did it in the cup final.
1942.
That would be fucking sick.
Imagine doing that in the cup final down 0-3.
1975, the New York Islanders did it.
2010, Philadelphia Flyers.
And then the most latest, 2014, LA Kings.
So this guy, Leafs hardcore fan, I retweeted today.
He said, why can't we be the fifth?
Because you're the Leafs.
No, and listen, obviously I'm extremely disappointed,
but the series isn't over. I feel like Toronto has a good enough team where yes they could get on a
roll and do this do I feel confident that they're going to do it no I don't um I'm actually pretty
disgusted at how how like non-prepared they came into this series I felt that considering they
were outplayed against Tampa during majority of those six games that that would have been the wake-up call and I was kind of
blaming it on the nerves and not having gotten past the first round with this group but this is
this has been an embarrassment like the the top guys in that game down 0-2 with their backs against
the wall were just really non-existent I would say the best of
them was Nylander who ended up making a nice play on that second goal for the Leafs but
fuck off with the analytic nonsense I don't care how many high danger scoring chances Tavares has
had throughout the series it's about results and to get I would say to to to not be dominant but
yet alone maybe be dominated in that first 40 minutes in game three was probably the biggest embarrassment as a Leaf fan I've seen in a long time.
And I can understand the frustration from the fan base where before this series, I would have said, I think that Dubas and those guys might end up keeping their job.
Where if they end up getting swept in this series, i would say everybody's job is over and done with
um as far as like the what they did shitty in the first series and what they haven't addressed and
gotten better at i still don't think they're breaking out clean enough hey man credit the
panthers for check as much as you want but army always goes back to the fact that they're too
ticky tack they always try to make that cute play they had that fucking game locked in in game two where bunting like the marner turnover where he
tries to go lateral to matthews at the blue line when he can just get it and even off the the first
goal uh when when mccabe off the draw where he kind of was going lateral just waiting for guys
to skate up and make a play to the middle like whatever happened to understanding game situation where you get to the maybe midway outside the blue line to
the red line and i think that most lease fans are going to know which play i'm talking about is where
nylander ended up kind of getting a shit sandwich from a cave off that draw tries to bring it to
the middle he gets out muscled off the puck they go back the other way and it's in the back of their net bang bang like live to fight another day get it out past the blue keep it on that strong
side martyr or our knee lander could force up the wall and then mccabe can send it down and then he
can win that battle to just get it below them and then you go back to work it doesn't always have
to be pretty but they always go back to the regular season nonsense that they can get away with in the regular season and they can't in playoffs.
And sure as shit, it comes back to bite them in the ass.
But that was game two.
Those were two mistakes that were made in game two that ended up costing it.
Bobrovsky played out of his mind.
They got out goalied.
But then the game three start in first 40 minutes was the most pathetic effort I've seen for a core group when they've been facing all the criticism that they've been facing for all these years.
And to the point where I say, well, I can't defend them.
I can't defend that effort.
You have nothing to say.
Their best line in that game three was the fourth line that had two guys on it.
Lafferty and Kampf.
Lafferty was a healthy scratch this series. He was the best player that had two guys on it. Lafferty and camp. Lafferty was healthy scratch
this series. He was the best player on the ice for them. They, they somehow after finally getting
out of the first round, have their fans more angry than ever. It's unbelievable that they were able
to do this. And you said like, yeah, they struggled and Tampa really took it to them in
at least four of the six games maybe like four and a half five if you want to get a little creative
with it but I I was with you I was like all right you know they just they had to get out of the
first round there was panic I was so sure that it was going to be finally we're done we can play
loose playing loose in a mental way not playing loose like they're actually playing
they're they're turning over the puck at the worst times in the worst areas of the ice non-stop and
here's the thing it's the best players on the team it like like tonight we'll get to edmonton
their best players were not good but you saw what their best players have done the rest of the
playoffs and to to actually get out of the first round and then do this, like, no,
it would have been worse had they lost the first round.
This is right beneath that for actually doing it.
And then showing up like this, like Matthews, what he,
he's one hand game three,
like one hand trying to flip it in while it leads down to the chance for
Samson off, got hurtty, power play goal against.
The turnovers in game two.
There isn't a goal score.
We heard about the core four from this guy for three up.
The core four activated.
The core four doesn't have a goal.
They don't have one goal in this series.
It's like, how is this?
How are you even going to say you come back and lose in
six or even seven? It has to change. I don't know who you trade. By the way, it wouldn't be
Nylander. Everyone's always like, oh, trade Nylander. Like, why are you going to trade him?
At least he, he looks like he's at least trying out there. I just, the Marner thing is so weird.
Like, I guess it shows how different regular season hockey is to playoff now,
where it's changed as much as ever.
I think this year has been like the first time, not the first time,
but where I've really said like, wow, I mean,
you really just have to get into the playoffs at this point.
You just get in and the game changes.
It turns into you need Sam Bennett and Matthew Kachucks and Nick Cousins
and these guys who are willing to absolutely do whatever it takes to win,
put the ego aside, chip it in, be dirty, play hard,
and the Leafs don't have it.
And Marner is this unreal, creative, skilled player in the regular season.
Dude, I think he has like six goals in his last 34
playoff games or something like that none of them scored after game twos of series
so i don't know what like is it is it is it his game that doesn't translate over
is it he's not ready to play is he's not willing to do what you have to do in the playoffs no
matter what it is they have to change something they have to get rid of one of these guys
and you can't get rid of Tavares.
So basically, it's like, do you trade Matthews or Marner?
Marner has 12 points in nine games so far in the playoffs.
Okay, that's another.
I'm glad you brought that up.
Who cares?
Like, you can put up numbers.
And granted, they had times in that Tampa series where they took it over.
What game was Matthews a monster in the third period?
They came back. That was game games three and four they came back game four they were down four one and that's when they ended up taking it on the road in Tampa so okay five four they they
have not been like horrible all playoffs and yeah Matthews is over a point per game I think the last
game was the first game Matthews hasn't had a point in the playoffs. But you can have stats and numbers
and still be the reason your team is losing.
Like, it just...
But there's also a difference between points
and seeing these dominant pushes.
And playing correctly.
Like, you go to Colorado, okay?
That top line.
And I'm not comparing these,
but they're getting paid the same.
They're of the same stature as far as regular season points where's the sheer dominance where they're taking over games for like
a full period or or or or or even or even putting together a full 60 minutes which hasn't happened
one time this offseason um another head scratcher or this yeah this second season um another head
scratcher was after game two when they had those
uncharacteristic quote-unquote uncharacteristic turnovers and keith says we hadn't seen these all
all playoffs long where i'm like you have i'm like what the what what video and games have you been
watching and that leads me to believe as to why some of the things that were causing problems for
them in the first series haven't been addressed and are still happening in round two where it's like i feel like they just felt like oh
unbuckle unbuckle the pants and you know let the belly hang out we did it we did it we did it the
city's going nuts and now it's just smooth sailing from here it's like nah nah this is when things
start to ramp up for other teams so the it seems right now also if you if you don't want to maybe blame the top guys because
you're not seeing the d join the rush and maybe they don't have those that five-man cycle that
other teams have where they play in unison as a team i feel like i'm okay with the physicality
that their d bring but with the puck they've been just horrendous all like all playoffs long
not only with turnovers but every time you
see them going up in a rush and yeah maybe sometimes it does get turned over you'll have
that second layer which is that d up on the play when they turn when they turn it over and it's
going back the other way sometimes it's like you don't see the fucking d until past the red line
when it's just inside the far blue line so there's's just no gap. They're giving up the line.
They're giving up odd man rushes coming back the other way.
They can't break out properly.
They don't want to fucking adjust to simplify things.
So overall, they're just getting dominated in so many areas of the ice where that's why I'm not confident that things are going to change.
The only thing I'm looking for in game four is take it period by period
and try to just win every period as far as dominance
fuck off with the rest of it just try to dominate and play a full 60 minutes and let the rest take
care of itself and the the overtime winner was like the most perfect like it's a micro micro
for the leafs so reinhardt gets the high flip i it was Ekblad. It's one on three at this
point. I think Brody was the man coming up, the defenseman. Kampf is back checking. Reinhardt,
he curls up at the blue line. He's now, you can see in the picture, three Maple Leafs. I don't
know what Kampf's doing. If that's Matthew Kachok or if that's Sam Bennett, he's running him through
the wall. Well, he like skates past him bennett he's running him through the wall well
he like skates past him almost like he's gonna chip it in and i'll go get the puck brody's sitting
off him he gains entry to the zone like i there was basically like four seconds it felt like he
had the puck like why isn't anyone going carolina would have had that turned over back the other way
like that right away and he goes in and then he so brody is in between him in the net he
throws it behind the net the camera pans over to lundell on the wall who throws it back behind the
net and as the camera pans back to where you can see reinhardt brody's now behind him it's like i
he's he's he's struggled this playoff and actually i he's had a tough role. And actually, I feel like he's been pretty solid Maple Leaf
ever since he's got there.
Like, I don't know, throughout the regular seasons,
I never felt like he was a complaint with fans.
I feel like Hall was more the complain all season.
Yeah, he was the whipping boy.
But that OT winner was just like, what are you guys doing?
There's just no lack of urgency.
And I tweeted out, like, I actually, no sarcasm,
feel bad for Leafs fans.
Like, nobody deserves this.
Like, you finally get out of the first round, and then you can't.
You go up 2-0 at home game two, which feels like I got to get this win.
We're going on the road.
We got to get one of them.
You blow that game, and then you blow this game after going up 1-0 early.
It's just unreal the way that they're able to lose in this horrific fashion.
But, like, going back to it, you have these four guys.
No one's taking Tavares' contract.
Nylander, okay, if you want to move him, go right ahead.
But you're not winning a Stanley Cup with this group.
You have no money to make, like, a signing.
Like, they're actually in a spot where they're completely fucked.
Like, their window to win is, what, the next five years?
And they have no chance to win a Stanley Cup with this team.
So I don't know.
Would you maybe trade one of them?
I guess we'll find out.
I think I'm okay answering that question after the series is over.
Because you just never know.
You never know, I guess.
There's a sliver of hope.
And I do think we need to mention the cats.
It's just, like I said just get in just get into the tournament and them losing the way they did
after winning the president's trophy it's it's like eerily similar to tampa now granted they
got swept in the first round not the second round but you learn and you have pretty much the same
roster there no i mean adding matthew kachuk right you you you, but you learn and you have pretty much the same roster there. No, I mean, adding Matthew Kachuk, right? You, you, you lost Huberto and you lost Uyghur while
Montours completely stepped into the power play guy. He's been amazing this playoff as he was in
the regular season. Kachuk, I think we can all agree. You'd rather have him than Jonathan Huberto
and they have just gelled at the perfect time they have a coach who's been around forever
that's a coach who you don't mind taking as as a recycle hire i mean he's just proven like guys in
winnipeg liked him he had the success in carolina everywhere he's gone he's with toronto and and
he's now had this team come together at the exact perfect time and they have a two-time vesna winner
who for some reason has struggled the past
few years ever since he got there playing as good as he's ever played so I don't know if anyone's
going to beat them I certainly don't see a chance in hell that the Leafs come back in this series
so now watch what happens um yeah I wonder if Kachuk's hand is all right because he blocked
that shot in game two his left hand and then they I mean they did a good job neutralizing
last game you didn't see too much yeah and and i said this on the broadcast before the game i said if i would
change one thing and it's obviously a little bit late because they had home ice why wouldn't they
have picked the line specifically toronto to combat kachuk bennett's and cousins line right
that's been their best line they create a lot of momentum for them they didn't do it in the first
two games well this last game i believe kachuk was on for one of momentum for him they didn't do it in the first two games well
this last game I believe Kachuk was on for one of the goals but they didn't do that much damage I
would say that's the most they've looked neutralized well that's because they sicked O'Reilly on him
for about close to seven minutes in five on five time he's not going to be intimidated by that he's
going to know how to play the right side and just make sure he gets out even so not only did that happen those other two lines
of stars just couldn't get it done even not even have to go against that difficult line of Bennett
Kachuk and Cousins so they finally do it in game three and then they get the result from that side
but then those guys don't show up so just very late to make adjustments and reactions where
I guess the one positive is stick with O'Reilly
and see if they can keep neutralizing that top line for them at least in my opinion and see where
it goes from there what you mentioned Sam Bennett he's a greasy little mofo but we're going to talk
about the wrestling movie did on Matthew Nye's got him concussed were you shocked he didn't get
even a game for that maneuver or no he you know that he knows exactly what he's doing there. He's got a rookie. He's got a kid
who was playing awesome. I mean, he scored the big goal in game two. And the fact that he just
went in there and he was able to make a dirty play look in a way that it was going to be tough
to suspend him in my mind. It didn't look great, but I don't know. Like I, I, I don't see a suspension there.
I don't know if Leafs fans will be in an uproar over that. It was just Bennett just being a prick
he is. And, and unfortunately you see the kid get injured. No one wants to see that. He'd been such
a big part of the Leafs since he came over from Minnesota and the Gophers, I mean, and, and just,
I don't see a suspension there, but I see a guy who knows exactly what he's doing and knows
how to just be a rat and just piss people off and and yeah injure a guy I mean I don't necessarily
think that was a hundred percent what he meant to do but still it was it was a dirty play that
I just think wasn't maybe dirty enough to get suspended I agree with you well and I'm a Leafs
fan I think I think what it shows me is I feel like the Leafs need a few more guys like Sam
Bennett in their lineup yeah that's what it tells me is I feel like the Leafs need a few more guys like Sam Bennett in their lineup.
That's what it tells me. A little DDT action
there. Not sure if you saw this. Kevin
McGrann of the Toronto Star reported the night
of Game 1 versus Tampa, there were threats
made against Wes McCauley's family and people
doxed him online because, you know, people
are complaining that he was referee
in the Toronto Maple Leafs game. Ironically, the
Leafs were 5-0-1 in the regular season.
I think they're 0-9 in games he's reffed in the playoffs,
but enough Leafs fans.
Yeah.
Enough.
Now, they do have a complaint that they didn't get a power play in Game 3.
I watched the whole game.
I didn't really see any missed calls.
I felt that game was unbelievably officiated,
and on top of that, there was one that the Leafs got away with
late in that game where uh it was wool you don't call them wall I guess I guess it's wool if you're
a goalie how do you not just say yeah just call me wall yeah I think it's wool wool wool that's
why some some guy dm me online I got I see everybody these fans are wearing how you're
pronouncing his name I thought it wasen. But he ended up tripping.
I believe it was Sam Bennett who was going for a wraparound
where it would have been a sure goal.
So, I mean, as far as officiating,
that's how I want my officiating in playoff.
Let the guys play and let there be flow to the game.
I told Biz at dinner,
we came out one of the first episodes of the playoffs
and mentioned how horrible the officiating had been.
I actually think it's been,
it's been a lot better.
Maybe some guys are kind of a shutdown for the year after the first round,
you need more bodies and you're getting your veterans,
you're getting the guys who've been around.
But as much as we dogged them,
I don't think lately it's been nearly as bad.
And there's been some solid officiated games.
I think,
I mean,
we touched on a little bit,
but Bob,
he's also just back to being Vez and the Bob.
It's unbelievable.
I don't know what  who knows what the hell has been going on there.
And everything you hear is like he's super focused.
Remember Keith Yandel told me he's one of the hardest workers he's ever seen.
He's dialed into his nutrition and all these types of things.
But he was just bad and maybe he
wasn't comfortable maybe he just didn't feel like going I don't really know but to see him do this
now it's like it's scary for anyone that's going to play against them because when you have a goalie
like this and you have a team playing their style they don't give up much or lately they haven't
and and the fact that he's able to look like this now is amazing after his last few years
yeah and I keep about that whole I don't want to give it any credence,
the conspiracy theory about Wes McCauley not liking the Leafs.
Keith said, Wes has treated me like a true professional the whole time I've been in this league,
and I've been very appreciative of that.
There's not even smoke there, so you can't say where there's smoke, there's fire.
There's absolutely nothing there.
And if sweeping up is, I think Keith and Dubas and Dunzo, if they don't win this series,
if they don't have a miracle comeback here,
I don't see how you bring both of those guys back after this season.
I think that's something I'll say when the series is over, R.A.,
but I completely agree with you.
He has beliefs, though.
He believes.
I mean, you're a fan, man.
Game four Wednesday at 7 o'clock in that series.
Any final thoughts on Toronto before we move on to Seattle-Dallas?
I'd like to see Lilgren back in the lineup. I think're missing a guy in the offensive zone to to be able to make
plays and i don't care if he plays 12 minutes i think that they just need somebody who they can
snap it around with too much of the same thing and we i know we talked about brody you look at
the duclair goal that was it was a it was a that leaves on the PK. It was just a regular breakout and they parted the season.
They got outside the dot.
So the mistakes that these D are making are driving me fucking insane.
Get Lil' Grin back in the lineup.
All right, guys, one sec before we continue,
I need to talk to you about the Chevy EVs.
You know, we've been a part of the Chevy EV family,
but we've got big news.
The first ever all electric Silverado is officially Barstool's
most valuable truck. We got the chance to see these and experience them, and it's a complete
game changer. Available 400-mile GM estimated on a full charge, over 10 feet of length in the bed
with this multi-flex tailgate combined with the multi-flex mid-gate, large 17-inch display diagonal screen,
and it can tow up to 10,000 pounds of max towing. Zero to 16 under 4.5 seconds with the wow mode,
that's quick, and up to an impressive 785 pounds of torque. So you hear EVs and you might not think
power? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
This thing's an absolute beast.
Head on over right now to chevy.com to learn more.
chevy.com right now to learn all about the new EVs
and how powerful these beasts are.
All righty, moving right along here.
The Kraken, they got goals from seven different players
in game three Sunday in Seattle.
They beat the Stars 7-2 to grab a 2-1 series lead.
This improbable match from the Kraken.
After a scoreless first, they chased Jake Audinger.
They got five goals on them in just eight second-period shots.
They got four of them in, what, 6-12.
Looks like Audinger probably should have got yanked even before that.
But the big news from that game, Dallas lost superstar defenseman
Mero Haskinen.
He got hit with the fucking puck right off the face.
We've seen that a couple times.
It's so gross.
What a shit.
So that game was pretty even at that point.
It was 0-0, very stingy defensively, both teams.
And then it was, yeah, at the time it was 0-0 second period.
I want to say it was Sprong who had a turnaround shot,
ends up going off of Suter's skate and then gets Heiskanen,
drills him right in the face.
He drops and then Eberle just scoops up the rebound, and just a calm little move.
He goes backhand, forehand, and then elevates it over Ottinger, who after that, this is
what Seattle does, is they play with a certain pace.
They don't open up the game.
They rarely allow odd man rushes, and then the minute that they smell blood and that the other team shows any type of letdown, they pounce.
You saw it in game one of this series where they scored three goals in 52 seconds.
And then you just mentioned the four goals in six minutes and 12 seconds.
So you just have to be prepared to keep that same detail to your game and pace for a full 60 minutes.
And that's what it makes playing these guys a pain in the ass and another thing is ottinger has like ungodly numbers and returns
after losses this season like vasilevsky like vasilevsky type numbers something about that
seattle building if you're a goalie who doesn't get to play there much it's darker and i even really i mentioned this on the broadcast i remember playing in certain
rinks where not only is the lower bowl very it's not very upright where it's it seems like it's
very deep so the depth perception not only fucks you up a little bit harder to open the gate of
the door shut the fuck up with it's
no i know what you're saying it's okay so you could ask people i didn't know that was darker
there it was oh and then even even a couple guys who do television have said like it's definitely
darker in here and they have the dark seats so sometimes when the puck is being shot and it's
over the dasher area it's hard to track with your eyes. So I'm just curious to know if he's
going to have those godly type numbers in game four, because he, that was the worst that I've
seen Ottinger look, not only all playoffs, but maybe all season, like uncharacteristic rebounds.
Uh, it didn't look like he was tracking the puck properly. Looked like he was rattled and really
not engaged. Hey, it's a long playoff he's playing every night there's no 1a 1b
with that team he's the guy they rely on so very interested to see how he bounces back from this
but just going back to Seattle man I think that everybody was kind of like what were their odds
coming into the season to win a Stanley Cup Seattle 75 to 1 I still don't think people
still believe it to be real but they're getting McCann back, their 40-goal score.
They look so fucking dangerous.
75-1, was that the worst odds coming into the season?
Oh, no, there were a handful of teams after that.
I was surprised they were that low, to be honest with you.
The depth is crazy.
I mean, how many different goal scores were there the other night?
16 now.
16 Seattle players have at least a goal, and they scored first at 8 of 10 games. I actually, like, how many different goal scores were there the other night? 16 now. 16 Seattle players have at least a goal,
and they scored first at 8 of 10 games.
And I actually got a line.
I got this kid, Dylan from Wardsville, Ontario.
He said, they're a team of four second lines.
And I was like, I'm not being insulting.
Like, he was complimenting.
I'm like, wow, that's a great analogy.
Yeah, and they never stop coming at you.
And I saw Ryan Donato's playing there.
He's had a real good year.
I saw his brother i follow on
instagram was at the game uh game three and just like putting the video up of the crowd they're
screaming they're going nuts the place looks bonkers it's it's it's a wild atmosphere it
seems like and they're able to just like thrive on their crowd and they get going and like i think
we've brought up tan have a lot like that's the type of guy it seems like they just have a bunch of them just yanni gourd same type piece of shit
yeah yanni gourd he's buzzing around veneers had this great rookie year everly's a playoff performer
he saw doing with the islanders and and i think their d's done a great job like even susie scored
the other night kind of a bad goal by andre that was a tough one five hole but then he went through
the bench and then he's yelling at dallas's bench as he goes through so kind of a disaster if
heskin's out dallas is they save so much money on dallas to win this series too i'm disgusted they
said that he would have came back if there was a chance to come back in the game okay they just
they said it was so out of hand that there was no point. So folks, listen, to describe this guy,
and he's probably the best defenseman left in playoffs right now,
a guy who was probably snubbed out of at least a Norris nominee,
set the record for points by a defenseman for their organization.
So far this playoffs, he's averaging 29 minutes.
So he's on the ice for half the game.
He's a one-man breakout.
He'd only up until the point of getting hit in the puck with the face with the puck, which obviously took a dash one.
He'd only been on the ice with all that ice time he spends playing against team top lines for five on five goals against for playing that in round one against Minnesota and the first two games against the Seattle Kraken.
So this guy is an absolute beast back there.
If he doesn't come back, in my opinion, they're fucked.
And the reason I say that is because right now, you know,
you got Ottinger, who's a star in that.
You got Haskin, who's a star in defense.
Robertson's supposed to be the star.
I don't know what's going on there.
He just doesn't look like himself.
I don't know if he's injured.
He came and lit the world on fire to start the
year this year it was on pace for over 100 points he might have even finished with over 100 points
but i would say the we always talk about how he's uh very good at a lot of things not excellent at
one thing one thing that i would say is part of probably part of his weakness is is mobility and
lack of speed he doesn't have that jump that some other superstars have.
And I really think that it's showing through in this series.
It looks less than even usual right now.
Right, because of the pace in which Seattle plays at.
And so people, you could look at game two from this series and say,
well, Seattle didn't look very good either.
Well, that was their ninth game in 17 days.
They had to take on the champs and go to seven and knock them off.
So they got those two days rest before game three.
That's all they fucking needed.
They looked like that fast skating team they had the rest of playoffs
after battling through nine games in 17 days.
So now that they've got the rest and they're back at home,
I wouldn't be shocked if they take a 3-1 series lead. nine games in 17 days. So now that they've got the rest and they're back at home,
I wouldn't be shocked if they take a 3-1 series lead. I don't like Dallas' chances right now, the rest of the series,
unless we're seeing the Ottinger that we're used to seeing.
We need the bounce-back game from him as a Dallas better.
Yeah, I just, I don't know what's happened because I just can't believe,
I just keep underestimating Seattle.
But they just bring so much to the table.
It's just pace.
It's just every single shift.
And I got to play with Justin Schultz in Edmonton.
That year of the lockout where half the season was canceled, Eberle and Hall and Justin Schultz, it was his first year pro coming out of college.
They played in the AHL together.
They were setting records.
Team was incredible. Season started, and things didn't maybe go in Edmonton throughout his few
years there as they'd hoped, but he went on to do a great job in Pittsburgh. He did a great job in
Washington, D.C. for the Caps, and now he's in Seattle. The other night, he looked unbelievable.
He still got that jump in his step. He's a great skater, and it's like all these guys,
the throwaway guys, the guys that teams didn't want,
have all come together and banded together to just believe in each other.
And somehow the way we talk about Bobrovsky in terms of,
I don't know what switch was flipped to get him going,
but look at Grubauer.
And, like, you're happy for a guy like that.
Like, it's been a struggle.
Last year was horrible.
And then even this year in the regular season, he wasn't good.
Martin Jones.
Yeah, Marty Jones carried them half the season.
So it's like goaltending is such a weird position
that you just never can figure out what can maybe give a guy confidence.
Maybe he's got something different in his mechanics.
You'll never really know until, I guess, postseason
or if somebody asks him, like,
what has basically happened to make you feel this good?
And part of it has to be the fact
that that's just a defensively sound team
and you're not having to deal with two-on-ones,
you're not having to deal with breakaways,
and then you're all vibing together.
So it's wild what the Kraken have done.
Not only do we underestimate them,
I underestimated their toughness.
I feel with Larson and Oleksiak,
they helped that team out so much,
not only being mobile, but in situations whereallas is trying to take it to him physically they're there to step up
for the boys and they're not backing down so no just just a overall unreal team that i wouldn't
be shocked end up in the conference finals and a bit of a redemption for hackstall as well as a
coach you know people kind of snaked when they brought him in last year they weren't great last
year who was also we mentioned the Jack Adams nominees.
He's one of the three, right?
Yeah, we got that a little further down.
So, I mean, it's a nice story.
A guy that they basically wanted to fire him after a year.
Now he's, you know, what, two games from the
conference finals. Game four tonight
at 9.30, but we do got to talk about Joe
Pavelski game one. Four goal performance.
Oh, we haven't even met up since that game.
No. Holy shit, man.
And it was followed by Leon's.
That performance by him to come back from a concussion
and you haven't been at this pace.
And granted, game one, maybe it's a little feeling out process.
He is just the number one goal scorer in the history of U.S.-born players
in the playoffs, and he just adds to it, adds to it.
Doesn't matter if he's slow.
He knows where to be.
Hand eyes off the charts.
And to show up and do that, you just wonder,
I don't know when this guy's going to slow down.
Let me ask you a trivia question.
Who are the only two active players right now
with more playoff goals than Joe Pavelski?
Crosby and Ovi?
Correct.
Yeah. And it's only Ovi? Correct. Yeah.
And it's only by one or two.
Is it?
It's that close?
It's that close.
Yeah, I mean, San Jose had a lot of great teams.
I guess that's not that surprising, but just steps up.
The bigger the game, the better he plays.
Leafs need a guy like Joe Pavelski, for Christ's sake.
I mean, it's just the thing is, though, when you're able to play,
and that's and I thought,
that's why I thought we'd discuss this. Maybe this was on game notes daily, check it out noon Eastern every single day. Um, when you're never that fast of a player, like as you get older,
it's easier, right? Cause you've never had to deal. You've never had to deal with losing that step
that all of a sudden costs you kind of like losing all of your time and space on the ice.
He's never had the step.
So he's been able to just figure out how to play at his pace.
And then his hand eye is not going anywhere.
And he knows exactly where to be being a veteran and being in so many playoff games
that he looks as good as he's ever looked right now.
He has career high in points last year as a 37 or maybe 38-year-old.
So he's just butt-chugging from the fountain of youth,
and he keeps getting better with age.
He'd be up there to switch lives with a guy.
He just does it all.
He's got it all going for him.
He doesn't have the cup yet.
You never know.
Dallas could do it if they can get by Seattle,
but as Biz said, it's not looking great right now.
Yeah, he's one of those guys, I guess,
it's just a natural at everything,
whether it's like ping pong, fucking pinball, whatever.
He's just gifted at everything.
Huge rope.
38 years, 10 months old.
He became the oldest player with a four-goal playoff game in league history.
The previous holder of the record, Maurice Rocket Richard,
back in 1957 versus the Bruins.
Not too shabby at all.
So, once again, game four tonight at 9.30.
Guys, before we move on, real quick, Biz, I have that stat for you.
It's Ovi has 72 goals
sydney crosby has 71 and then joe pavelski was 69 all right before we go any further here's a word
from our friends at sport clips it can be stressful to describe the kind of haircut you want and even
if you feel like you got it across it's hard to know if your stylist really understood you
too often hair care results in a hair scare. Fortunately, the stylists
at Sport Clips Haircuts speak the language of hair. You could say that they're fluent in fades,
literate in long locks, and just about all-around clippers confident. It doesn't matter if your hair
is balding or billowing. Sport Clips stylists are black belts in cutting men's hair. They've been
specially trained to do it.
These pros are artists.
You are the canvas, and each of your hair follicles is the happiest of trees.
So sit back and relax.
It's MVP haircut experience time.
That means a seven-pressure-point massaging shampoo,
a perfectly steamed hot towel,
and the freedom to not have to stress about a bad cut.
Next time you need a cut, come to Sport Clips and get a head-turning haircut from the pros in men's hair.
All right, guys, now we're going to go over to New Jersey, Carolina.
And after looking at their depth and being outscored 11-2 in the first two games,
the Devils came to life in Newark, beat the Canes 8-4 to crawl back into the series.
The newly toothless Jack Hughes played like an absolute beast. Two goals,
two assists. Probably should have had a Gordie, right?
I mean, they gave him an awful... No, even he
said that wasn't a fight. No, that's the modern...
That's the Jack Hughes-Gordie Howe
or the Jack Hughes-Hattrick. That's what I called it
on there. The wrestling match? Yeah.
Yeah, it was pretty entertaining. His little brother
Luke Hughes' first playoff game had two assists
in 14 minutes, 28 seconds.
Timo Meier finally got on the board.
He should have got his first goal.
If the Devils are woken up or the Canes are going to snuff him out next game.
Devils are awake.
They're awake.
And Carolina, that's the worst I've seen them in a long, long time.
And that scares me.
Brendan Morissette, they hadn't played a game that bad this year.
That was horrific.
Their timing was off.
They didn't look like the pressure team that they
always look like i just wanted to go back to the first two games where like the pk clinic that
carolina has been putting on against the the new jersey devils this season coming into playoffs
um they were 0 for 14 allowing three shorthanded goals or maybe four shorthanded goals during the
regular season they
hadn't scored a power play goal all season long so after the first two games they were like oh for 20
allowed a few more shorties and then even the third game in which they won they allowed three
shorthanded goals so total on the season right now seven shorthanded goals they've allowed against
the new jersey devils which is fucking pathetic by the way, do you ever think you'd have two teams have a guy score four goals
and another team get three shorties and all the teams lose?
Yeah, that's wild.
That's a wild stretch of hockey.
But I would say that the changes obviously worked out well.
Luke Hughes looked incredible out there.
He was snapping it around, helped their power play it even looked like.
So as far as the big guys finally
coming to play i think that what they learned was is they have to do their damage below the dots
and you saw that early with that first goal where timo meyer scored it how about the effort by jack
hughes getting in on the forecheck he battles off two guys and then goes one hand pop by wrist
just like bedard does with his fucking shot and slides it between his legs to clear space for
him and that like that's a huge monkey off the back for timo meyer who i want to say had the
most shots coming into that game in all playoffs who hadn't scored a goal he had 29 shots no goal
so he hadn't even had a point to that point so with him uh brat finally getting going we mentioned
hughes and then he's sure and then he's sure finally scores his first goal playoffs as well.
So with all those guys playing and it seems like they have an MO at least,
which they can bring into the next game to try to go at Carolina with,
I very much get the vibes in which I did in round one,
where this is far from over.
I feel like if,
if,
if you're on the devils,
you lose those two games in Carolina and you're
like, guys, we're fine. We lost the two games at home against the Rangers. I mean, you're looking
at it. That's how you have to look at it. Like, all right, well, they held serve, but we are
completely fine. We had to go on the road after losing two and we got it done. Why can't we go
home, win two at home and then end up getting it done this series?
So obviously, like, they're not starting series the way they want to.
But for a team that just lost two home games, that's no worry at all.
All right, well, big deal.
This is actually a better scenario technically
than what we had to deal with last round.
And they came back and they had the greatest game
probably of their playoffs so far.
Now, giving up three shorthanded goals, granted a couple of them were at the end
when the game was a little bit out of reach.
Other than that, they just had everything going.
And Luke Hughes going in, he only plays 14 minutes, right?
But it's the ability to have the puck and get it out of the zone that cleanly.
To have a guy who can make a play on his own.
He can beat a guy one-on-one.
He can snap it up tape-to-tape to a bunch of forwards that if they can get it with speed
in the neutral zone, that's what they need.
So Devils fans were like, we got to get this guy in the game.
He gets in, gets two assists, look great.
I think he made the mistake that ended up leading to the penalty shot goal that Martin
Nook scored, which was a sick goal, by the way.
Soft, soft call.
Did you not?
Yeah, I didn't necessarily agree with that one. But that was Luke Hughes's only error, I would say, in the way. Soft, soft call. Did you not? Yeah, I didn't necessarily agree with that one.
But that was Luke Hughes' only error, I would say, in the whole game.
And shout out Jordan Martinuk, too.
We said earlier, the guy was on waivers this year.
How good has he been?
I mean, he's just been like lights out on the PK.
He's a force on the fourth line.
So that's the type of guy that's like a Carolina Hurricanes type player.
He's just always on the puck.
He's a dog out there.
But I just think the Devils are in a great spot,
and mainly because for those guys to get goals,
and he's Sharon Meyer, it's this weight off your shoulders.
It's like, oh, my God.
We've been winning.
We've been playing well.
We hadn't won this series.
But now that we got going, it's like now I can play.
I'm not gripping the stick a little extra tight.
And for them to get those goals, get a win,
I think they're going to tie this series up.
I really do.
I think this is probably going to go seven based on Carolina at home
has some sort of magic where throughout these last few years,
they're almost unbeatable there.
And you look at them on the road, and for some reason,
they just don't play the same way.
Now, we saw that Carolina crowd when we went to the Edmonton-Carolina game this year,
and you can kind of see how they vibe off that.
It's an amazing experience.
You talk about Seattle and their team kind of riding off that high.
Carolina's no different, but for some reason on the road,
they don't even play the same game.
They don't keep it as simple.
They don't have as quick a shift.
So they did win two road games in the first round. I would say in the last three. The Islanders don't keep it as simple. They don't have as quick a shift. So they did win two road games in the first round.
I would say in the last three.
The Islanders don't count, though.
Okay, fair enough.
They're an AHL team.
Over the past three seasons, maybe even four seasons since Rod's taken over,
they have not had a great overall road record.
So I would agree with you where the road presence,
they don't play as quick and on their toes.
They look a little bit more passive and that's not going to work because that's their mentality.
And if you're not all on the same page, it looks ugly at some points.
The one thing I would say to change up is I think you go back to Schmid.
Oh, I was going to bring this up.
Really?
There's nothing that Vanacek's doing that is that impressive.
Like, he didn't make any big stops.
I don't feel like he wasn't tested.
And it seems like every game he's playing in the playoffs,
he's letting up four or five goals.
Like, that wasn't that.
Based on what these guys have accomplished come playoff time,
and Ari, I don't know if you have the stats on hand.
I don't think Vanacek's got more than two, maybe three playoff wins.
That might even be stretching it. I mean, yeah, that was his first stat more than two, maybe three playoff wins. That might even be,
that might even be stretching it.
I mean,
yeah,
that was his first thought since game two in the ranges the other day.
So he,
and he obviously lost those two.
So there's no,
there's no,
no deserving the net because the team put up an eight spot for you.
Yeah.
Schmidt's been the best calm goalie.
He seems like he,
he just,
he's a big guy.
He just holds his angle and yeah
the two games on the road i thought i thought the devils played horrific brutal they didn't they
didn't deserve to win so go back to schmidt after getting the one game rest and and see how he can
kick for you in game four that's that's i i enough with the superstitious bullshit and i think that i
thought that luke hughes should have been inserted into this playoffs before before he should have been game two at least game two of this round yeah
now if you're rod though i mean freddie got yanked gave up four goals on 12 shots anthony
rantha didn't dress he was sick and what's that kid peter kachetkov come in 18 you go back to
anderson you go back yeah he's been he's been unbelievable and and i don't think you want to
go back to a goalie after illness. You lose some of the electrolytes.
You're a little fatigued.
To go back into a road playoff atmosphere,
Anderson's been solid in the first two games of that series,
and he helped close things out in game six for Carolina
in the last series too.
So he's kicking right now.
He's in rhythm.
He got his rest at the end of game three.
He needs to start game four.
No questions asked. And the Devils, they've now won three in a row at home in in game five and seven
against the rangers this big game three win like they have something brewing at home too the crowds
into it and why wouldn't they be right it's just a it's a fun team to watch like i was all over
pasha i ended up telling him i was wrong um the only good thing for Biz is like you're not exactly as worried
as you would be about the ass tattoo, I'd say.
Like, you know, they got to win four or five
against a really good sound hockey team.
So it's going to be hard to kind of do that against this Canes team
considering they have two more games at home.
But I think the Devils now have figured out a way to play against Carolina
in terms of not giving them the puck, right? Like they just live off you turning it over.
They live off you making soft plays. And I just think game three, it was them being harder on
pucks. It was them creating chances in the offensive zone where in Carolina, the first
two games, they had nothing going. Like, I don't think Schmid played well.
I don't think the team played well.
But overall, it was like a completely different effort getting back home.
So I think you're going to see the same thing in game four.
Yeah, the Canes became the fourth team in first in 40 years to score three shorties
in the same playoff game.
And the Devils are the third team ever to win a playoff game when allowing three shorthanded
goals.
I can't believe they weren't the first.
Do you have the stats?
I think I might have butchered it off the top because I'm not the numbers guy,
but they have given up seven shorties so far this season against Carolina.
And that was the goal.
They scored a power play goal in game three,
which was the first one they'd scored.
One for 22 regular season of playoffs combined with seven shorties allowed.
Get it right here.
Yeah.
Brutal.
Unreal.
That's red rotten. My God. Seven shorties allowed. Yeah. Brutal. Unreal. That's red rotten.
My God.
Seven shorties.
Yeah.
But hey,
I'm interested to see what they bring in game four.
All right.
Next series,
Edmonton Vegas.
We just watched a game three disaster for our buddy,
the wit dog.
What was the final five,
five,
one,
right?
They got,
I mean,
they got waxed.
We'll go to you first.
What do you,
I mean,
immediate reaction.
We just finished the game here.
An enormous letdown. go to you first, Wade. I mean, immediate reaction. We just finished the game. Yeah. An enormous letdown.
Like, you know, I'm not as down as Biz at all right now.
I think they could have won game one.
They didn't play great, though, but they were somehow still in it because of Leon.
And game two, they were awesome.
They just took it to them.
What's upsetting as a fan is we haven't seen, like, many great games.
And it does go into the second round.
Excuse me, in the second round.
And it does go into the argument that like the first round is that crazy,
that physical, that much of a grind just to win that first round
that you see the level of play almost drop down a little bit.
And it certainly has seemed that way to me.
I mean, every series we've had a blowout game or two of them. I mean,
in terms of the Devils series, there hasn't been one good game yet. Now, Edmonton, they had nothing
tonight. Absolutely nothing. They get out to the one nothing lead. Fogle scores his first goal. I
actually think he's been pretty good all playoff. He's finally able to get a goal. They're at home.
And from then on, that was the worst game they've played by a mile in the
playoffs they had a horrible first period in game four against la they had the miraculous comeback
that's why down 4-1 they put in campbell this game but it did nothing and it was one of those
things where like you know that that goal was called back uh who scored that goal martin roy
scored the goal so excuse me martinez drove the net biz said right away i think
that's getting called back i i didn't see it i mean when a guy has the puck and this is an oilers
fan talking guys the puck drives the net gets a shot on net i don't really know what what you're
supposed to do and and and dave jackson on espn they're they referee guy, like you have. We have we have Coho and Brad.
Yeah, you have Coho and Brad.
So Harsky Jackson said right away, I'd call this one back, too.
I just think if you're if if you're carrying the puck and you get the chance, it's really hard to then call goaltender interference.
I don't think Martinez did anything malicious.
He didn't really look like he stuck his foot out or stuck his stick in there.
It was just like a bang bang play.
But the Oilers got lucky enough where I thought it was a bad call. 10 seconds later,
puck don't lie. Vegas makes it makes it 5-1. So they just had absolutely nothing going.
But I think they'll bounce back. It's one of those things where the same way they bounce back in game two, the same way they've bounced back the entire playoff. They lost game one at home. They won game
two first round. They lost game three on the road. They won game four on the road. way they've bounced back the entire playoff they lost game one at home they won game two first round they lost game three on the road they won game four on the road like
they've done a great job at really bouncing back and figuring it out so I think they'll be able to
and you're almost just looking at this game as a complete stinker what's what's upsetting is you're
at home and this crowd we talk about these home ice advantages Edmonton you talk about Seattle
Carolina Edmonton might be the best one.
To play like that was disappointing.
I mean, they had  that's the one worry, right?
Like if Leon and Connor don't have a big night,
that's kind of what you see from that team.
Now, it hasn't happened at all until tonight.
But when it does, it's that ugly.
And Vegas, I don't want to say it's all Edmonton playing like shit.
We talked to Miggs, our Vegas insider from Daily Game Notes.
They are a very, very disciplined team.
That was their most disciplined in the league, right?
I know you guys are going to think I'm fucking around,
but in game three, why do you think they dominated so much?
Because they kept it five on five.
How many penalties did they end up with?
I think they got
I just got a power play at the end of that
like penalty kill and then they end up scoring when it was four and four anyways to make it five
one they might have got one in the third we started recording but they didn't they they played a
perfect road game tonight and and they got jack eichel going yeah in this second round which most
called i don't know people want to put a lot of stock into the first and second or overall pick
going at it but the way that fucking eichel looked into the first and second or overall pick going at it.
But the way that fucking Eichel looked at the crowd
and gave her the shimmy shake after scoring that goal to make it 4-1,
I feel like he's playing with a chip on his shoulder
where he's got something to prove.
And, I mean, as far as their center ice right now,
with him, Carlson, and Chandler Stevenson,
this is a fucking deep team, man, that needs to be taken very, very seriously.
You know, we got to give a tip of the hat to Aiden Hill.
He come in for an injured dollar.
Ron Proswale got hurt.
That takes scary to me.
I've been pumping his tires when he was with the Coyotes.
6'5", 6'6", huge wingspan.
If they play, if they do a good job of taking half the net away,
Vegas, very good at blocking shots from the back end
where if you're a goalie and you're just
playing the right position and you're covering up a lot of the net, even for a guy like that,
if he's already on his knees, which Waino hates, you're covering up a lot of the top of the net.
So from a structure standpoint, they have very solid goaltending. Big guys, Brassois, him,
and then who knows, if they need to, they can go to the guy with experience, Jonathan Quick,
who ended up coming down and getting dressed halfway through the game
when Bersuad went down.
And that was tough to see, boys.
He's had hip issues before.
Yeah, he's had surgery, and that didn't look good.
It was non-contact.
He pushed off.
And you just feel for a guy.
To miss most of this regular season, come back, play well,
and it looked pretty bad.
And all class by the Edmonton fans as well.
He had played there, I think, juniors before, minor league maybe,
and they gave him a stand-in.
I mean, you hate to see a guy hurt, but it was a very classy gesture
by the Edmonton fans.
But for Aiden Hill to come in and then not give up a goal,
that's worrisome as an Oilers fan.
Like, all right, not only does this guy come in, he's big, he can play,
which has obviously been proven with what he did with Arizona and what he's done with Vegas. And then he has the confidence now. So you got to think
he's going to be the starter. The way Broussard skated off the ice with help, I don't think he's
going to be back. So you have quick backing up and now you have this guy, oh, I just went in and
played against the best offensive team and didn't give up anything. So like I said, I think the
Oilers bounce back and and in
game four they'll they'll have a much better effort they have to but that was that was a
supreme disappointment now the biggest disappointment i would say and they ended up killing the penalty
but that penalty by evander kane at the end of the first period like i totally understand we'll go
back to game two with him and colasar and what happened. The kidney shots? Yeah, when he's down, just drilling him, fuck around and find out.
But Oilers were so bad in the first period.
They got out the lead.
They ended up getting it taken to them the rest of the way.
Well, Petrangelo is holding the puck in the corner.
There's about three seconds left.
And I don't mind Evander Kane.
I'm going to go run him.
I'm going to try to get something going, at least end the period with some sort of ruckus,
and maybe we'll just get a little bit of a scrum.
We can get the guys fired up for the second.
Go in and hit him.
He went in and, like, cross-checked him in the face, it looked like.
And it's just like.
That's assault, brother.
Just a stupid penalty where all of a sudden, yeah,
you get the penalty kill to start the second period,
but it's like a momentum thing.
There's just no need for that.
And I understand, like, what he's trying to do, and it had worked in game two,
but you can't do that.
It's unnecessary, and it's something where, like, all right,
let's get into the intermission, and let's try to figure this thing out,
but now we've got to kill a penalty to start the period.
And then Vegas just kept rolling even though they didn't score.
So, Biz, you asked for how many penalties Vegas had in this game.
They had three.
Mark Stone got an elbowing, Jack Eichel interference.
When was their first penalty taken?
First penalty was taken at the 15-minute mark in the second period.
And they scored when it was 4-4.
And then the Oilers, you know, didn't get anything done
at the rest of that power play.
All right, what do you think of the third?
Kane fucked around and found out from the refs tonight, Biz.
Yes.
I want to ask you, Biz, is there times when it's okay to ignore the code a lot of people getting on kane for
hitting colasal so there's been a few times this playoffs where there's been fights where guys have
been punching each other on the ground who was there was one the other night i'm trying to think
of who it was and uh there was another scrap where a guy was just feeding each other in that situation
the one thing that pissed me off and i think it was
the exact same where they ended up on the ground was when the ref jumped in where it looked like
they were gonna go yeah just i i bitched about it with the flurry incident with binnington get the
fuck out of the way let the guys figure it out themselves you know it's just like all of a sudden
he's on the ground he's getting these kidney shots because there's all these bodies flying around
let them stand on their feet and let them go at it i i mean yeah it's it's a gutless i wouldn't punch a guy when i was
down unless he did something behind the play like stick me in the balls where i wanted to gouge his
eye out or give him the fish hook yeah kane said it was because basically he grabbed him from behind
i don't know if he jumped the foot behind that was his justification for doing that but colasar
looked like he wanted wanted to fucking go on yeah, though. Yeah, he's not shy.
I don't think he's shy and he wouldn't back down.
Not at all.
He had that big scrap in the first round, too, that got them going.
We did get one of the best photos of the first, I'm sorry,
the playoffs thus far with the fan giving the double bridge
that came in and him blowing the kiss.
I mean, just an incredible fucking photo.
One of the best we've seen all playoffs.
Tonight's game, zero points from Leon and Connor combined.
They have two and seven in such games in the playoffs. But we do, zero points from Leon and Connor combined. They have two and seven such games in the playoffs.
But we do got to go to Leon's four goals.
I mean, we had them back to back.
He's been incredible.
He had six goals in those two playoff games.
The second most ever in a two-game span in the playoffs after Newsy Lalonde back in 1919 and Yari Kari in 85.
His 13 goals is the most ever through a play.
His first eight games of the playoffs.
Again, Newsy Lalonde and Michel Goulet back in 85 with the Nordiques. His 13 goals is the most ever through a play. His first eight games of the playoffs.
Again, New Zealand and Michel Goulet back in 85 with the Nordiques.
What he's doing is incredible.
Then Bouchard, he's had 14 points, the second most points by a D ever through their first eight games of a playoff after just part Vin and coffee.
So these guys are setting records.
But let's go to you once again, Whit, on Leon's four-goal performance.
I know it was all for naught, but just fucking impressive as hell,
especially that soft little dainty one he put right off the back of his head.
That was so nuts because to think of that,
like players are behind the net or behind the goal line,
and you could have the idea of like, all right, yeah,
there's a little room there.
I can get it off his back.
The way he laid it up in there, it was like the perfect high saucer pass
right off his nameplate into the
back of the net it just takes so much skill and like he scores goals in so many different ways
he's got the big old paddle we've talked about and he's got the one timer he's got the quick
release on the shot and then he's got a backhander that's like the best backhand passer in the league
like Crosby-ish and and he's just able be so creative. So like that game one, what he's been doing
and then game two to get two more.
It's like, you could say that he's as successful as he is
a lot of times because teams are so focused on McDavid,
but I don't know.
It's like McKinnon, McDavid, and then Leon.
This guy is nonstop.
And I love the fact that he is a playoff player.
He loves the physicality.
He gets involved.
He threw a big hit tonight I saw behind the net.
And he's just never afraid to shy away from anything.
And he's so big and strong that he actually knows it benefits him
if guys want to try to play him physical.
He'll bounce off you.
He'll cold shoulder you.
And he's just turned into such a dominant player.
It's a little scary. I mean, he's on, I'd say, maybe the best contract in the league. He makes 8 off you. He'll cold shoulder you. And he's just turned into such a dominant player. It's a little scary.
I mean, he's on, I'd say, maybe the best contract in the league.
He makes 8-5.
I mean, look at what he does.
Really?
Yeah, that's going to change.
Oh, he makes more than that, doesn't he?
No, 8-5, and he's only got one year left.
I thought he made 9.
Could we check that?
I thought he made 9-5 or 9-8-5 or something.
No, no.
Oh, my God.
He's in the seventh year of the
deal i think it's an eight year deal so he signed it that long ago where grunelli check it maybe i'm
wrong i'm probably wrong i'm an idiot but he uh he's only signed that one shirelli he only he
should still be around for that one actually but he's only got one year left so i mean you do you
do worry about that who knows what's gonna happen i'm not that's not something you're really trying to think about right now it's getting dark here
yeah but yeah exactly all those fans you're already talking about shut your mouth shut your
mouth no but um it was just it was an amazing performance unfortunately you know you have to
have a legendary game a memorable game like that and a loss but he came right back he got two in
game two and that mcd, the shorty, the shorty
he got, holy shit. I don't know what Theodore's doing, trying to like dangle at the blue line
when that's the guy that's like hounding the puck near you. That's not the guy you want to mess with,
but just McDavid to get the step on him, to get that goal. That was just such a great bounce back
effort by him. It's kind of why I'm confident going into game four, but Leon is just, he's a
legendary talent. He really is. He's, he's unbelievable. The fact that they have both
those guys, it's, it just is, it's scary to watch that team and know that at times, if they don't
get power plays, they're in trouble. And they were able to get the Fogle goal tonight. Maybe that
gets him going. The main issue right now is Nugent Hopkins and for the season he had we pumped
his tires 100 points he lit it up he doesn't have a goal and I don't I don't really know what's
changed maybe doesn't look as confident with the puck maybe isn't shooting it enough where he has
chances to dish and sometimes you know you you don't have confidence and you haven't scored so
you're like all right we'll get it to another guy I'll make things happen another way I think if you're
him you just got to start shooting more shoot more often and get one of those dirty goals but
they're not gonna be able to do anything unless he gets going no matter how good McDavid and
Dreisaitl play and and when you have like a talent like that you need him to perform like
you're you don't win in the playoffs without your best players being the best players in the
playoffs, and he really hasn't
been. So just to
Leon's contract, he's getting paid
8.5 until the 24-25
season. So in
25-26, he'll be a UFA.
Damn. Wow. Two more years. He'd look great
in a Kyrie jersey. Yeah, two more years. He does?
Yep, two more years. Oh, okay.
Great. So take away that we only have
one year with him left.
Pivotal game four is Wednesday at 10 o'clock.
Huge game for the Oilers and the Whit Dog,
of course. Alright, before we go any further,
here's a word from our friends at Labatt.
Lots of things are better together.
Hockey, food,
golf, watching TV.
But if you really want to take
things to the next level drink some labatt blue
lights with your friends and live life to the power of we gee what do you say well it's funny
you mentioned that already because this past weekend i went over to a friend's house and what
did i do i brought a ton of labatt blue lights and a lot of people actually have never had them
before at this party and i dished them out And the first word that came out of everyone's mouth was refreshing.
It is such a refreshing Canadian Pilsner that it's,
it's the beer of the summer for me.
Absolutely.
Beer of the summer,
winter,
whenever.
Labatt is great anytime.
And it especially goes great with pizza.
I've kind of found out,
gee,
so find a Labatt near you at labatt.com.
Ah,
that's it for all the series boys.
We just got a couple,
a couple of notes here.
Well,
before we wrap things up, first round ratings come in biz. I'm sure you probably heard, heard about him at Tatt.com. That's it for all the series, boys. We just got a couple of notes here before we wrap things up.
First round ratings come in, Biz.
I'm sure you probably heard about them at TNT.
Noticeably up all across the board after the first round.
And the Panthers-Bruins Game 7 was the highest rated cable game ever on TV.
Holy shit.
That's pretty cool.
So not including if it was on ABC or NBC.
Yep.
Wow.
Cable, not like free TV over the air, which I know people don't say that anymore.
Well, speaking of that, great news for Vegas fans.
They're going to air all locally broadcast Golden Knights games for free
to residents of Nevada in the team's TV territory start next season.
So awesome.
The stuff I've been bitching about kind of been leading the charge,
I guess you'd say.
You know, all these people were trying to stream or watch the game,
and they're in this zone.
Well, Vegas is like, whatever you watch this shit on,
whether you stream it, cable, satellite,
you're going to get the game no matter what.
So I want to say that the Phoenix Suns
are taking the approach of where they're basically
creating their own network where anybody in Arizona
can watch the games where you think, man,
it's just like if you can make it self-sustainable
with ad revenue, where you're paying everybody on top of that, you're getting this, this advertising
where you're bringing this product to everybody in the state for free, where you're going to have
more people paying attention and buying merch and buying jerseys and more invested in your franchise.
It's a no brainer. And with all these issues happening with Bally's and with what's going on with where TV's headed,
I wouldn't be surprised if more teams took the approach where they own that and distribute it themselves,
even if it's through an app or online or some form of streaming service.
Just find some type of way to make it available for free to everybody in your area.
You got it.
What they call the RSN, the Regional Sports Network.
It's like, wow, you're starting to see them fade a little bit.
So, hey, I'm psyched.
I mean, I hope every team in every sport does.
I mean, that's the whole idea, to get everybody to watch your freaking product.
So hopefully it'll catch on.
The Senator still, yet another celebrity.
Oh, my God.
Abel?
The Weeknd?
Is that Abel?
Yeah, Abel.
I only know him as The Weeknd.
So what group is he involved with uh
kimmels who who used to be part owner of the pittsburgh penguins before they sold to uh who'd
they sell to the boston or the fenway sports or fenway sports that goofball owns the red sox john
henry yeah the toronto billionaires i guess with um and then now we go with three celebrity laden
package deal well package deals opportunities to buy the Sens.
Haven't heard anything on Sandra.
Oh, I know we kind of got a little scoop earlier, but I don't know if she's kind of a silent pot in some way.
We haven't heard her name publicly, but I don't know.
You get the weekend versus Snoop versus Ryan Reynolds.
And that did you see that Snoop clip?
I went on ESPN.
I mean, it was awesome.
It was great.
He knows like I mean, he's been watching hockey since I mean, the L.A.
Forum back on the day.
I mean, of course, he wore the gin and juice video,
had the Pittsburgh jersey on, which they now call the gin and juice jersey.
And he said, like, I've been all over the world.
In some places, just show your extra love.
And he's like, Ottawa is one of those places.
Like, you know, he wasn't, I didn't get the sense he was full of shit.
I thought he was being very, very honest.
So, I mean, it's going to be interesting, however this plays out.
But you've got to think the NHL is a pretty good hard-on for Ryan Reynolds here.
No matter who ends up getting the centers, Reynolds will probably squeeze him in.
If he's not part of the first group and they don't get it,
I wouldn't be surprised if he pairs up with whoever the eventual buy is.
All right, you know what I would love to see is Ryan Reynolds get the Senators
and then the NHL force the sale of the Arizona Coyotes to Snoop Dogg.
He would be perfect for that region.
I just think, I don't know, I mean, Snoop Dogg in Arizona,
he's talking about growing the game
in inner city communities.
Is weed legal there?
Yeah, it's legal.
He'd be perfect in Scottsdale.
He can do it medically or even recreationally.
Oh, no shit.
It just passed, so.
God bless it.
They all should be doing that.
Get Snoop involved in the NHL.
Yeah, no, absolutely, man.
Love to get him on the show, too.
I feel like Snoop you'd rather
have than ryan reynolds so i just think from a from like a content perspective and and and bringing
out the personality you've seen what he's done with the rexham team i feel like people want more
original content especially behind the scenes stuff you're seeing it with how the golf series
has popped off how they started it with that f1 series, where that's how people need to become attached to the players and the organizations in order to draw people in.
So I feel I just felt that he would be the best candidate.
But after seeing what Snoop said on air and how passionate he is about it, I think give it to the highest bidder.
I just believe that because it's with a development play with the Reynolds group, that they're going to find deeper pockets in order to execute maybe a bigger idea.
This is bigger than just buying the Senators and keeping them in Canada.
This is about getting something going downtown with a whole district associated to it where they're probably going to own bars, restaurants, condo units, hotels.
units hotels like i can only imagine the amount of doors they're going to put downtown surround this arena where they're gonna the team will be a as far as a money play a second it's going to
come second fiddle a true story my brother paulie walnuts he once saw i sold a couple of ounces to
snoop dogg when he was staying at the boston harbor hotel like 25 years ago he went to the concierge
my brother's friend he's like hey i need some bud so he called my brother up my brother i don't got a couple of uh ounces of hydro somewhere and
hooked up stoop got a picture with him in the room he didn't get the smoke i'm not surprised
yeah you can't be with us mcgonigal boys when we get him on interview and you can ask him about it
absolutely yeah like he's gonna remember do you remember that one time
got weed from?
Yeah.
What?
Like that doesn't happen every trip he goes on.
Seriously, right?
A couple of sad notes from the hockey world.
Peter Klemer, who played nearly 900 regular season
and playoff games for Detroit, Edmonton, Tampa, LA, and Pittsburgh,
died at 58 in his native Chechia.
We want to extend our sympathies to his family, friends, and former teammates.
Of course, he's probably most famous in the NHL as game one,
triple overtime game winner at the Boston Godwood way back in 1990.
He was benched.
He hadn't played, I think, since the first period.
And John Muckler threw him out there.
And the longest game in Stanley Cup Finals history, he ended it.
That was awful news.
And, you know, I was seeing some things.
He went through some struggles in his life, maybe with some addictions.
And it's just so sad.
I mean, that's such a young age to pass away.
And I also didn't realize until I hockey DB'd him and checked it out when I heard the news.
Like, some big years with Detroit.
Oh, yeah.
Edmonton, a really super talented player.
And that was tough to see.
Yeah, and I think Edmonton was,
got a sticker on the helmet.
You know,
one of the teams passed away.
Yeah.
It's pretty,
pretty nice.
And the teammates seem,
seem like a pretty call of a guy.
I know you mentioned,
you know,
he had some problems and issues with it,
but the teammates seem to really enjoy him.
And I also want to send condolences to the family and friends of Peter Good,
who passed away at age 80 last week.
If the name doesn't ring a bell to you,
Good created probably the most brilliant and maybe beloved logo in all of sports the hotford wheelers logo like you know i mean
every time you look at it i think it was 20 years before i realized that there was an h and a w in
there not just a whale tail on the water so i want to give a guy like that acknowledgement it's such
a huge part of the pop culture aspect of hockey so again i was sympathy you still see carolina
rock in the jersey occasionally absolutely never, absolutely. We never actually talked to you, R.A.,
about rooting for the Florida Panthers
and being all over them after they knocked off your Bruins.
He says money talks.
That's all he says.
Yeah, I mean, I had a future on them.
I mean, I probably would have been pulling for them anyways
with Matt on the team and, you know,
pull for a family friend.
But, yeah, man, the Bruins got their asses waxed.
They didn't deserve to win,
and I got a pretty good-sized future on Flaura. Of course I'm going to roof all of them.
I mean, you know, it's not like I'm going to be a fan forever,
but, you know, money talks and bullshit
walks, bitch. You know that better than anybody.
If they get to the finals, will you hedge?
Possibly. I got to see who they're playing
and what the odds are, but yeah, I'm a big let it
ride guy, but if, you know, if you can middle it and guarantee
yourself, well, I don't have to say numbers
on the air. I still don't trust certain
government agencies out there, but if I can middle at a good price, I don't want to say numbers on the air, I still don't trust certain government agencies out there, but
if I can middle that at a good price, I probably will.
Speaking of Gamma,
last note here, Kentucky Derby, 15-1
Mage wins it. I don't think I heard one
person say to take this horse. No,
my sister-in-law did. Claire,
she sent the family group chat
that, hey, I like the
eight horse. And it was at 6.05
I looked, and I was like running around with the kids, and I was like, oh my God, all of a sudden I saw the eight horse. And it was at 6.05 I looked, and I was like running around with the kids,
and I was like, oh, my God.
All of a sudden I saw the picture after with her and my brother's winning ticket.
I'm like, oh, my God.
How much did you win?
I don't know.
I don't even know what they ended up putting on them.
I'm not going to give away money either, even if I did know.
RA's teaching me.
There's government agencies gunning after chicklets listeners and fans.
Enemy of the state.
I got a TSA on my ass.
He's looking out his blinds in his room.
The bigger story out of the Kentucky Derby is like,
why are these horses dying?
Because they're all juiced up.
Is that what it is?
They're on the gas.
I mean, they had-
What the hell is going on there?
These horses are beautiful.
I just told you.
They're beautiful animals.
They're all dying there.
They're made in a lab.
And they're on the gas.
I think seven of them that week. And that crazy like i mean they shut down oh they they actually
had jammers no no seven horses died at that track that week that week yeah because of like what heart
attacks i don't know you just said that no i'm what else did they die from did they that's what
i asked oh okay it's usually various like you know could be a heart
attack or they maybe kick back and they break their leg it's usually a variety of things but
do you remember the show luck on hbo we did one season terrific season they did and like i think
two horses died and it didn't even have anything to do with the filming aspect like one of them
ran back and you know broke his leg and another one had a heart attack and because like you know
peter and animal animal rights they shut down production of this fucking major HBO show
because two horses died.
Nobody did anything negligent.
It's just a sad coincidence.
So, like, and seven of them died there.
And of course, they're not going to cancel the fucking Kentucky Derby.
We know that.
I've heard of, like, in old days, if a horse broke his leg, they would.
That was some of them.
I think two of them had broken legs and they had to just euthanize it.
They can't just put them in a thing that carries their torso.
They're so big that even when the leg heals, it'll never be enough for them again to be healthy.
Imagine you're a human, you break your arm.
They would have killed me 15 times.
Oh, which ankle again?
Chloe's dreams sustained a right knee fracture.
And the owner said, in the interest of pursuing the most humane treatment for each horse,
the owner, trainer, and private veterinarian, in consultation with a board certificate,
unique surgeon, made the difficult decision to euthanize.
Poor animals.
They're like, let's get one more load out of them.
Horses are incredible.
Jesus Christ.
So sad.
Horses are incredible.
Jesus Christ.
So sad.
Just maybe.
So,
so I would,
so if you said only to sustain that,
then probably a few did have jammers because I think it's pretty known that majority of these guys are juicing these animals up.
And that's why that Baffert went down.
It's like,
it's like the Russian hockey team.
They're just sticking needles in their arms.
I'm sure that probably was the case in a few of them business.
They're obviously not going to publicize that.
I'll probably come out months later when they do their examinations or whatever.
But I just have one final note I meant to mention earlier.
Shout out to my London squad that I coached this weekend.
The Trico Wildcats, those great crew of guys, mostly Chicklets fans.
I just hung out with them.
I feel like I know the guys for years, just after a couple of days.
They were sick, too.
They were.
A couple of those guys, seriously, Biz, we might not have a little recruitment going on.
We'll see what Terry Ryan's saying.
He's the coach.
Absolutely.
All right, before you wrap up,
next episode is coming Friday this week.
After that, we'll be putting out
the Charles Barkley episode Tuesday.
We'll be going back to one episode a week next week,
and then we got a sandbagger coming next week,
Josh Richards and Dave Portnoy versus Biz and Whit.
Tune in on the Trick or Treat YouTube.
Fucking A. We're going for eight in a row.
Alright. Can't wait.
Alright, boys. Great show. Thank you
for listening, folks. Go Oilers.
