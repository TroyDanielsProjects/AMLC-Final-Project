Hello everybody and welcome to episode 488 of Spittin' Chicklets
Presented by Pink Whitney from our friends at New Amsterdam Vodka
Here with the Barstool Sports Podcast family
What's going on everybody?
We're in the stretch run of the season right now
Things are heating up.
But we had a little controversy in Chicklets Land this last week.
We have to address immediately.
Paul, Biz Nasty, Bissonette, the wit dog.
You got bombarded by Jersey.
Let's back up.
We got to tell the story, man.
Everyone's been yapping about it.
I got a lot of complaints.
You have a lot of spunk, and I hate to have to throw it to this early.
I feel like you're feeling very lively today with that lid choice.
I hate spunk.
I am.
You hate spunk. I am. Well, what was...
You hate spunk?
I hope so,
unless it's your own and your belly button.
Now, what's the...
I hate spunk.
What's that from?
Why do you keep saying that?
Mary Tyler Moore.
Did you have any clue?
Mary Tyler Moore, this early in the show.
Yeah.
That's from the 50s, uh no 70s yeah 70s yeah
don't go that hard on jesus christ i didn't raise your heart that was actually the levity that we
we needed off the hop here now uh i guess we'll dive right into it guys obviously the sandbagger
is a pretty big component to what we we do around here it's kind of like a you know um like another
entity as you would say and and it's evolved over time and these have been something that that bring
us a lot of joy uh it gets posh and more in the mix we got the whole crew in the mix really doing
them so um you know and i and i guess i'll start off by saying too like i know we do a lot of
things for content a lot of things are for fun and and you know
silliness and and we enjoy doing all that stuff but this is part of the job that's that's not fun
and uh it sucks and what was supposed to be something that we were celebrating today and
celebrating the sandbagger it kind of turned into this controversy as you would say all right we're
not going to divulge like too much of what's going on but we're going to basically say that
we've made the decision to take it off of the internet. The backstory behind this starts years and years
and years ago between Jersey Jerry and Kevin Connolly. We obviously decided to do this sand
bagger with Kevin Connolly and Sean Avery months and months and months ago. We've been talking
about it for months. We would we would assumed if like anything,
if there was an issue,
it would have already came up based on how much we could,
we communicate and how excited we were for this thing to come out.
It was edited to perfection by Pasha.
There was some incredible moments.
Like Avery had such a fucking sick moment.
It was so fun.
He had the best pot and spit and chiclets,
sandbagger history,
sandbagger history. Sandbagger history.
And I think that hopefully that clip can live on and get the attention it deserves.
But I had no prior knowledge, neither did any of us, of this issue that was going on between Jersey Jerry, a now employee of Barstool Sports, and Kevin Conley, who'd started Action Park Media, a media company.
Avery's with them, obviously. Kelly Stafford in the past. It's kind of like, you know, it's grown
and it's had people jump on, people jump off, whatever have you be. It's a media company,
just kind of like Barstool, maybe obviously at a smaller level. So we tease it on Wednesday
and Thursday, you have a show with Dave Portnoy and Kirk Minahan called the unnamed show. Cause they haven't named it yet. And you get bombarded by Jersey Jerry about this issue. Now we were going to roll the clip on here, guys. I don't think we need to, if people care that much, they can kind of go listen to what Jersey Jerry had to say about his experience at action park media
but it was obviously coming from a place where he felt that he'd been completely disrespected
he felt that he was owed money or he sent an explanation as to why he'd been let go didn't
feel that he got that and then there was a rift that ensued that there was a legal battle uh that
i believe is still not finished that stemmed from it but once again guys we didn't some people will say, like, there's been a lot of criticism. Oh, you
guys should have known. You should have done your research. Like, you know, why is it, you know,
why are you getting in the middle of it? Well, the reason that we're in the middle of is because
when we dropped this video and that clip of Jerry went viral, the chat was completely bombarded by
people basically saying like, you need to pay Jerry.
So it was just completely engulfed by whatever was happening as well as the
comments online.
So wit,
like you were on the phone and stunned by the news as it was coming in,
trying to kind of make sense of it and process it on your own.
Now we hadn't at that point on Thursday when we ended up dropping the sand
bagger later that day after Whit had kind
of heard that you know it did what it did and it lived till Friday now on Friday Kelly Stafford
had messaged this Jersey Jerry about her issues at Axial Park and then it kind of just got even
bigger and it grew and then it's taken on a mind of its own millions and millions of you so
we just kind of hopped on we're like i think considering we don't know enough about the situation let's just pause the video on youtube
and then do some digging and after doing a bunch of digging we just decided that it's probably
too an inflammatory thing right now to drop again we i i have never had any type of bad experience
personally with kevin connelly myself like he's always been kind to us i've met him years and
years ago every time that we're with him we I enjoy our time just like we did with
the sandbagger and same thing with with Sean Avery when I met him at Bonnaroo years ago and he he
came up to me and he goes hey I appreciate you uh you know using your your voice to amplify like
you know same-sex marriage and stuff and I thought it was a great icebreaker and he was so polite and ever since then we've maintained a friendship and i got to do a road warriors
youtube video it was it was every time i'm with him too like our personalities match i think he's
a funny guy i understand he's a polarizing figure but he's not the reason why this video came down
like he's just collateral damage at this point so what was supposed to be
a fun video for everybody to view kind of turned into this and we just think we're doing the right
thing by by taking it all down we're not taking sides here i i honestly genuinely hope that these
two can just hop on the phone and squash this and maybe we could re-release the video i have no dog
in the fight and i it's it was uh like when things like this happen like when
the bab it's just it's not fun like it causes stress like this was my first weekend off in
five weeks and i was fucking you know i had to you know these are guys that i consider buddies
where i'm like fuck we got to take this video down and like i don't know how you guys feel about it
it sucks it all just fucking sucks and uh we we would have already provided a time
timestamp for some of you people who are like what the fuck we don't even give a fuck about where you
could have fast forwarded to to just not even care or hear about any of this i don't know what your
feelings on it with like i just kind of want this to go away i hope that they resolve their issues
and we just want to do the right thing and that's pretty much all i got to say i
think i've hopefully covered all the bases and once again we did we didn't we didn't have any
prior knowledge of this and we're sorry for the people where we didn't do the research but we
figured when we talked about it before if there was anything that would have been an issue it
would have already have came up by now that we would have been made aware of so there you go in
the end um a great video so it's it sucks that it's not on
there anymore and and i still really appreciate appreciate both those guys drove down from la to
san diego gave us a day of their time an entire day and um but in the end after after talking
you know to a few different people it was just just like, all right, well, the way Conn's
handled this with Jersey Jerry, I don't agree with.
Now, I sent out a tweet where I called him a weasel.
Probably regret doing that.
And in a sense where I've had people call me that are friends with Conn's and say,
take the tweet down.
And I'm like, I don't delete tweets.
I think he was a weasel in how he handled the situation with Jerry, okay?
I have no ill will personally to him at all.
He's never done anything but be friendly and nice to me.
Same with Aves.
I don't know Avery that well,
but I feel like we've gotten to become decent buddies.
But I'm sure these guys hate my guts now.
But in the end, I'm not going to delete a tweet in which I said that Collins was a weasel because I think in that situation he was.
So it's a shitty situation.
It was a great video.
But in my eyes, if you're going to fire someone, and I'm not even talking about the money that, that Jersey Jerry says he's owed.
If you're going to fire someone,
it's right to give him an explanation,
wish him,
wish him luck in the future.
And in,
in the end,
after grilling Jersey Jerry and asking him questions,
it seems to be that,
that he wasn't necessarily treated how,
uh,
you should probably treat someone when you let them go from your company.
So I,
I'd rather kind of just like move on from it,
I guess. Uh, it's because it's between him and Kevin
Conley.
But in the end, it just sucks that the video's not up because that putt that Avery hit, that
clip needs to be out there.
Tough way to start the show.
I mean, this isn't ideal for us.
I mean, I'm not looking to make a big stink out of anything,
but in the end, like a guy that works for the same company as us
was kind of screwed over.
And it's like, all right, well,
I'd rather kind of try to be on the right side of this,
even though it doesn't necessarily involve us,
if that makes any sense to anyone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I don't think anyone,
not everyone's going to agree with the way that we handle things, guys guys like we're willing to take the criticism just as much as anyone so
you know have at it we if you respect our decision and you're kind of ride or die with chicklets we
appreciate that as well um another thing too just like you mentioned their time and them coming down
for a full day like these guys are busy guys they got shit going on too uh like our crew as well
like posh just spent a lot of time editing that,
which was like a cinematic masterpiece
as a result of having to have him invest his time in it
and then take it down.
We have lifted his suspension.
This is as upset as any listener is going to be.
Some of you listeners think,
why are we getting punished twice?
But it ain't like he's going to be hopping back in the mix to give his shitty hot takes.
And also to Sean Apuzzo, to Logan, to Fishy, to all the other guys who have to spend a day schlepping around a golf course to make sure they get every shot.
We have an amazing crew that we love and we appreciate you guys.
So hopefully we can get the busing with the boys at one out sooner rather than later. I
don't know what fucking country posses in now right now and, and, and whatever he's doing,
like the trust fund baby that he is. So when he's back from his, uh, his seven day vacation in the
South of France, maybe he can get back to editing. So, um, in the meantime, I'm sure JT Miller will
keep lighting the lamp and lighting him on fire. And I'm sure we can just really right now get back to editing so um in the meantime i'm sure jt miller will keep lighting the lamp and lighting him on fire and i'm sure we can just really right now get back to what has been
an incredible incredible hockey season this saturday was saturday was ridiculous if if we
would have told you buffalo and detroit were playing a game this late in the season that
would have been relevant you would have fucking laughed me and us offstage.
So it's been unreal. Ari, I'm going
to throw it back over to you. And Ari, I know you
weren't involved in the sandbagger.
So I think we can just get back
to hockey. I don't know if you had anything to say on it.
Oh, actually, actually
you do have something to say.
And before we get to hockey, we have even
bigger news than what's going on
in the NHL playoffs.
I'm the only member of the podcast to know.
Yeah, Corneli and I, before you came on, were like, what is this?
How did I almost forget?
And then we're guessing back and forth.
R.A., I mean, the fact that Biz knows, it should have been all three of us here at once.
But you guys were on a call getting ready for some things, so I understand.
What the hell news do you have?
Something
crazy. It hasn't happened in a long
fucking time. The last time this thing occurred,
the Patriots had
zero Super Bowl wins.
Shrek was in theaters,
and 38-year-old Adam Oates
led the NHL with 69 assists
tied with Jaromir Jaga back in 2001.
You got laid? Huh?
You're on the right track.
You're kind of right.
So I'm back up in the game.
You're kind of right.
I'm single again.
I'm fucking for the first time in
20 something years I'm a single guy.
R.A. is back
on the market.
It's kind of weird. It's fucking kind of crazy. I don't know. It's kind of awkward. I don't know it was going to happen, but I'm back in the game. It's kind of weird. It's fucking kind of crazy.
I don't know.
It's just kind of awkward.
I don't know.
It's a whole new fucking life realm, whatever.
But yeah, I'm officially.
I hope you could talk better on your first fucking date.
Holy hell, man.
Get it out here.
I know.
It's just like, do you have food in your mouth?
No.
We need to show him fucking mar No. For the very first time.
What are you chewing fucking marbles to,
buddy?
You said date.
The last fucking thing
on my mind is like,
actually going on
a fucking date.
I don't,
I have no desire
to go on like a
fucking old school date.
Dude,
it's crazy.
What do you mean,
buddy?
You're single.
I know.
He wants to skip
that process.
You just want how
biz does it.
Hey,
let's meet in the lobby.
I'll talk to you for one second and then whack.
Shut up.
R.A., you're going right to fucking hedonism, aren't you?
Dude, I didn't get laid there the first time.
Why would I go back again?
No, it's weird.
I mean, 23 years.
I mean, that's like fucking, it's kind of a weird reference.
You're like Brooks getting out of prison in Shawshank. And he's like walking around and he's like.
I'm not going to stream myself up.
I feel like we have to do a Bachelor show featuring R.A.
Okay, so we've been talking about this.
It kind of like wasn't news, but R.A. mentioned that he was going to mention it on the show.
So we had to play it up like it wasn't that news.
Ray mentioned that he was going to mention it on the show.
So we had to play it up like it wasn't that news.
And since R.A. has told us behind the scenes,
like obviously we feel for you in the fact that there's a breakup and there's emotional involvement.
But then selfishly we're like, oh my God,
imagine this guy on a Bachelor show.
And if we directed it, put all the pieces around you
and had 25 women, like, we're going to have-
We should have it like Winnipeg or something.
We got to have at least five women represented from Southie.
That has to have a thick Boston accent.
Because chances are, if you do end up with a soulmate again,
you would want them to have Boston roots.
A couple of extras from Gone Baby Gone.
Got to get some John Charles. We got to get some John girls in there, especially. A couple of extras from gone, baby gone. Gotta get some, like, we're gonna get some dot girls in there.
Wait,
that's the prerequisite is,
is they would have had to have been an extra and gone in the town as well.
Has to have appeared at least three as the Superbowl parades and,
and,
and,
and,
and,
uh,uck onto one
duck boat. All right.
Do you think you'll get
in the app game?
I don't know. I feel like that's just
so normal now for single people.
I know, but dude, you got to think. It's been
23 years.
Basically, the last time I kissed someone
other than my wife was before 9-11.
It's such a weird reference, but it's a new world, dude.
That one took a right turn.
I know.
I was like fucking right into the ditch.
Some people laugh.
Some people don't.
I mean, fucking Millennials made it a meme.
I didn't think it was a big deal.
But yeah, it's weird.
It's definitely strange.
And, you know, like I said, going through a breakup in a long time.
And yeah, this happened a few months ago.
I told you guys on one of our road trips. And yeah's it was pretty tough to do it buddy yeah it was it's
stressful and you're like you're also like you're coming out of your routine which you've known for
a long time so like anybody's gonna get thrown off by that like i i struggled with my last breakup
for a while yeah yeah exactly it was but you you know, whatever. Eventually, you move on.
You get to a different place in your head.
But now that I'm there, it is kind of crazy.
But it is fun.
I can just go to the tavern and just, like, fucking talk to every girl in there.
What's the best way for ladies to hit you up, R.A.?
Should they slide into your DMs on Instagram?
What about performance enhancers?
You think you'll, like, take, like, a five milligram of something before your first new body?
He's on 60 milligrams of weed all the time.
You can't mix that with other stuff.
I just like a little fiber to kind of give me that half an inch extra.
And also like a quick second poke if you need it.
Well, I call it the insurance policy.
You have a few cocktails.
I'm not exactly in my 20s anymore.
What's your milligram game?
What's your milligram game?
It depends how many rounds you want to go.
I'm talking about, I do Cialis.
I don't do Viagra, because Viagra gives me a headache.
That's a little tidbit for you, Ari, if you get that.
Really? I didn't know there was a difference.
I find a little C bump gives you a little bit more consistency.
It doesn't all hit you at once.
Why are you shaking your head, G?
A little C-bump, I love that.
I'm not saying I need it.
I'm saying it's just like you said, R.A.,
you go out on a long night, you want to dance a little bit,
you want to have a little extra stamina later on.
I'm not talking like I need the full 20 milligram
and I want the rocket launcher.
I just need a little bit of a, you know right yo i would say that um one of the number one things that happens with
people once they you know become single or get divorced is like they get into shape like do you
think thanks wait oh but i'm just saying do do you think you'll hit the gym and start working out?
He's getting enough exercise shaking right now.
I don't know if you people are watching on YouTube.
I can tell it's a little uncomfortable for you, RA, but that's okay.
We're going to walk.
He's always shaking.
Not like this.
Neurotic fucking.
It's a little heightened right now.
Well, it's ironic.
Fucking San Andreas over there.
heightened right now.
Well, it's ironic. Fucking San Andreas over there.
I'm actually lighter now than I was 23 years ago when I started dating my soon-to-be ex-wife.
What if R.A. becomes that old rip dude that does those multivitamin ads?
That's not happening.
I'm pretty sure he'd be cleaning up.
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, maybe I will.
Like I said, I haven't been-
At the lawn bowling club?
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, maybe I will.
Like I said, I haven't.
At the lawn bowling club?
There's got to be like one 50-year-old single woman that listens to this show right now that is like, oh, my God.
R.A. Single.
Like, this is my chance.
Well, that's what I'm saying.
I love this guy.
And now I have like.
So I guess your DMs are open. since we're doing this show RA what's
the age like what's the cutoff here that's you're not gonna you're not gonna go on you're not gonna
go on a single for like the the 1920s right well well no that that's funny what you brought that
up is because like you know like I'm fucking 51 years old soon to be 52 and I'm not a spring
chicken so it's a weird thing like I you know
you don't want to be
that creepy fucking guy
you don't want to be
the creepy
oh too late
but it's also like
alright
if like
I guess like
hey we could still
improve in other areas
let's keep going
down the list here
but like
you know
it's like
like you know
flirt my ass off
all the tab it all weekend
it's like
you know
loosen the arm up
see if I can
what do you lead with What do you lead with?
What do you lead with?
Oh, it's a paddle.
Whatever.
You ever seen Leave it to Beaver?
Hey, you ever see the tab?
Hey, what was the funniest thing you ever said on television?
Hello, ladies.
He's like, but before he does it, he's like.
Who's your favorite character in the Brady Bunch?
Want to smoke?
Here's his tweet.
Dude, so, no, like, last night,
oh, what's happening?
Want to come check out my Playboy subscription?
I have the first ever magazine.
Oh, my God.
Do you know I've snuck into
four different Stanley Cup champion locker rooms?
I could get us a free flight to Chicago to go on Jerry Springer.
Do you want a basketball lesson?
But the side show, it's the Steve show now.
There's no more Jerry show.
But I got an in.
All right, we're done.
It's like a whole new world, dude.
For real.
Last night, I was on the tab and a very nice young lady came. For real. Like, like last night I was on the tab and, and,
uh,
very nice young lady come up and say,
Oh,
you are.
I was like,
yeah,
I,
you know,
I was talking to this girl for a couple of hours and I'm like,
see where it goes.
Like nothing ended up happening,
but like she was in her late twenties and I'm like,
you know,
I'm like,
I don't,
it's weird,
dude.
Like,
I don't want to like,
you know,
make me a creeper,
Phil,
I'm making someone uncomfortable.
But at the same time,
you know,
some of these,
you're a rock star, baby.
You can do whatever.
I think you'll know if they're interested or not.
They'll probably run away
if you're being a creep.
No, no, no. I definitely had
good vibes over the weekend.
But I would say, and they'll probably call me
a pedophile online because everyone's a pedophile nowadays,
but I would say probably late 20s and up.
And I know that sounds weird, but I think at that age,
it's like, well, they're women.
They're not young girls.
They've had some life experience.
And basically, the last five girls I talked to were on their late 20s,
and I had good vibes going.
Nothing come out of it.
But it's like getting, I feel like Roy Hobbs after he got shot
and he was coming back to baseball.
Are we saying, uh,
so 28 is the cutoff.
Oh,
I'm not,
if you show up,
if you all of a sudden have a 28 year old rocket girlfriend,
I mean, talk about the tides turning.
Talk about an absolute miracle.
I mean,
we're talking Doug Flutie from the 50 against Miami or wherever the fuck they
were playing.
If you pull this off, R.A., good for you.
But I would say it's probably like 35 and up.
You want a 28-year-old girl?
No, I'm not.
No, no.
Just for the number of you.
You said upper 20s.
No, I think he said what the  he said he gave an example as to like I had a normal
conversation with a later 20- a later 20 year old.
So he would be in consideration if we did the show or excuse me,
when we do the show,
if there were a few 27,
28 year olds in the mix that obviously fit the criteria of sneaking into a
parade duck boat,
uh,
behind the scenes at a Stanley cup,
you know,
we got the list Southie,
she's robbed the bank,
all of it,
all of it.
Now,
um,
yeah, I, I think i'm done for questions i
just would love to see i would there used to be a game show where two guys would go head to head
and go into a bar in toronto i forget the name of it and they would see who would have better game
and these guys these guys what's that mortal combat it's like let's go one-on-one who who's leaving with a girl right
yeah but they would go separately and there would be a panel it was kind of like impractical jokers
but for daters and they would go in the bar and the three guys i don't know if they were talking
in his ear about okay yeah let's see what you can like how you can like try and talk to this one
and the guys would have horrible game and they would just be torturing them upstairs so that would be a fun concept
too but also if we can do an
RA bachelor though and me and you
can host it biz like that would be
probably our best
piece of content of all time
yeah that might be in
play at some point like when biz first brought it up
I was like still like in
morning I was like biz let's just pump the brakes a little bit
here buddy I just we just settled this last night like yeah let me get back in the mourning, I was like, let's just pump the brakes a little bit here, buddy. We just settled this last night.
Let me get back in the swing here.
I'm like, all right, that's horrible news,
but hear me out here.
Hear me out.
I'm trying to think right now.
Well, they passed on my mansion idea.
I'm thinking of what's going to change for us.
He can't get more fucked up on the road than he already gets.
I don't think we're going to be dealing with anything.
Challenge accepted.
Oh, God. Here we go.
You know what, though? The criteria for who you pick has
to have caretaker because she has
to be the one on the road with you. We'll cover
the flight and hotel, but
she can take care of you for crying out loud.
We're going to have
our own version of The Bachelor coming up.
Well, I will say, you boys, since we started this,
I've been betrothed with my old lady, but it's Dunzo,
so you guys never seen me single.
It's a different animal.
We should do a DraftKings bet.
If he ends up remarried, stay single the rest of his life,
or getting back with your ex.
So I think we can move on because there's a lot of hockey talk to get to.
Was there any other questions you guys had?
I think the fan base is probably like, what?
Is this even a hockey podcast anymore?
What the fuck is going on here?
All right.
I get two things and then we'll move on.
I haven't thought about it fucking forever.
Two things, and then we'll move on.
That I haven't thought about in fucking forever.
You know, when you've been locked up that long.
When we were down, I think it was New Jersey,
we went to the stadium series.
And that was like the first weekend.
I was kind of like stretching my muscles a little bit again.
And you're talking to girls, and you're like,
oh my God, the insecurity, dude.
I haven't had that in like 23 years.
Because you've been married, you don't think about it.
Everyone gets it, but it was like, holy fuck, this feeling sucks. They haven't had that like 23 years because yeah you've been married everyone gets it but it was like holy fuck this feeling sucks they haven't had it forever and then it's also like uh it took
me fucking 29 years to find a woman i'm comfortable naked in front of now it's like i gotta find
another one to keep my t-shirt on when i'm banging or you gotta get on the fucking testosterone get
back in the gym i mean i go chucking weights regardless i mean i'm still gonna look like
fucking et with my shirt off so i don't think it really matters if I'm throwing fucking 45-pound plates around.
But anyways, ladies, I'm available.
There we go, boys.
So one last question.
You haven't been laid yet?
You haven't had one new partner?
Okay.
Can you please let us know when that happens?
I am horny as a hostage, dude. Just for the record.
Guys.
I'm horny for hockey.
I'm horny for hockey.
I'm horned up for offense.
Let's go, baby.
Guys, Whit here.
It's Pink Whitney time.
New Amsterdam's own flavored vodka, Pink Whitney.
And I actually was leaving the BU game this past weekend,
and a woman came up to me. She was in one. She was
having a grand old time. I believe her son was on Northeastern. She said, oh my God, you're the
Pink Whitney guy. We had him at brunch this morning. We had the little nips at brunch this
morning. I'm feeling great. I love your drink. It was an amazing thing to see just somebody on a
natural high, even though her son
or nephew just lost a big playoff game. Nope. Pink Whitney just had her flying high, feeling good.
We had a great conversation. And then St. Paddy's Day was the next day. So it was, you know,
you have a couple beers, you have the green beer, but boom, I was down in my hometown. I grew up and
people had the nips out at the parade.
I couldn't escape it. I couldn't escape it. All the support we get, all the people who drink Pink
Whitney, you guys rock. We appreciate it. Remember, they have the now big ass bottles,
those 1.75 milliliters. They're enormous. They last a long time. I'm going to be in Chicago,
like I mentioned during the show for NCAA March Madness games, days one
and two. The Pink Whitney will be flown.
It's one of those things, if you have an over
or an under and you need the game to switch, boom!
Quick shot of Pink Whitney. That's what hockey fans
do. That's what fans of Pink Whitney
do. It's the number one flavored vodka.
So take your shot
with Pink Whitney. Go to your local
bar, order it up, have a grand
old time like that woman, even though her son lost the big game, and enjoy Pink Whitney, Go to your local bar, order it up, have a grand old time like that woman,
even though her son lost the big game,
and enjoy Pink Whitney.
And we thank you once again for drinking it.
The number one flavored vodka in the world.
New Amsterdam's own Pink Whitney.
Imagine a Wings and a Chicklets fan right now.
Their team can't fucking win a game,
and they got already talking about being horny.
So let's get this thing going. Let's talk
hockey. Well, they got sponsored by
erectile defunction company with the jersey
ad. So at least we're winning somewhere. Go
ahead. All right. Well, Mez will jump right into it.
I guess Newsies Red Wings. They're
hanging on to the second wildcard spot right
now. 74 points in 68 games,
but the 24.9
percent chance to get in the postseason, which
is kind of weird for a team in a playoff spot right now.
Obviously, Dylan Lockett got injured.
They went 0-5 the first five games out of them.
Seven straight they lost.
But, Pidge, you just mentioned the fucking, what's it,
a garbage company, Jersey, Priority.
They've been terrible in those frigging things.
I mean, they've ruined the shirt.
We've talked about it before.
We don't need to get in the advertisement again.
But they've kind of ruined the shirts.
But Dylan Lockett has skated.
He is going to be back this week. The goaltender has kind of taken a little bit of a dive. Whit, do you think the Wings get in the advertisement again, but they've kind of ruined the shirts, but Dylan Lack in his skate, he is going to be back this week.
The goaltender is kind of taking a little bit of a dive.
What do you think the wings get in or what?
Well,
I mean,
I guess we got to just start by saying before wit,
it's like this wild card race in the East.
It's,
it's fucking incredible.
I've completed.
It's also pathetic.
I mean,
it is incredible and I love it,
but have you ever seen a bunch of teams vying for two playoff spots
play worse than this right now?
No, you take it.
No, you take it.
No, you take it.
I was trying to take the positive approach.
It's positive in a sense that we have a bunch of teams in the mix.
I'm pretty sure we're going to get the final five games
being the final two spots up for grab.
If not three spots, depending on Philly.
But this is some pathetic hockey.
And it starts with the Red Wings.
And in terms of being positive, Biz, I'll be positive with you.
For Red Wings, I'll give you some positive news.
Your Dylan Larkin contract is magnificent. Yeah. And you have him for seven more years after this year
at an absolute bargain for the type of player he is.
Now, the negative aspect is he's out,
and they're horrible without him.
It has been a disaster.
And, I mean, with the start that DeBrinket had
and what he was doing at the beginning,
I mean, I think he was leading the league in scoring
through eight or nine games.
I remember it was an immediate impact.
He was doing awesome.
The city was buzzing.
He's got four five-on-five goals in the last, like, 50 games.
So you can't get by in this league with your top players
not playing big-time hockey at five-on-five.
And then you got your other top player who's injured, who got injured at the worst possible moment. in this league with your top players not playing big-time hockey at five on five.
And then you got your other top player who's injured,
who got injured at the worst possible moment.
So what's funny enough is Pasha, we could say his name again, he's back.
He's such a little bitch.
He's like, their underlying stats have been bad all year. And I'm like, oh, you say that now after they've lost six in a row at time.
He's like, oh, no. Oh, you didn't want to say it before.
But if that is the case, there you go.
I guess it was a little bit of smoke and mirrors throughout the season.
But what's weird is like you just you talk about starts in the NHL and like you cannot have bad starts over and over.
And the wings right now, they're just fighting this uphill battle.
They're giving up the first goal.
They look horrible in the first period.
And then you're losing.
The Coyotes have won four games since the new year.
They beat them twice in a week, and you're fighting to get into the playoffs.
What has it been, seven years since the Wings got in?
It's just, it might have been, is it nine or seven years?
I don't know, almost as pathetic as the Buffalo Sabres,
but not quite there.
Either way, it's like, I just don't understand
how a team can just play this bad
when they've had this magical run.
Unless Pasha is completely correct,
and the whole time, and a guy with no shirt on
is running by and pisses his screen,
so I don't know what's going on there.'m staying on my buddy joey superstein's house my 2016 was the last time
they made the playoffs too my fluffer as we call him last time i got laid too he's gonna love that
that's that's donnie's boy remember i told you guys about donnie the legend and as much as we've
pumped alex lion's tires for what he did with flor Florida and what he's done earlier this year I think it's like you start to see why he hasn't necessarily become a true number well it wasn't
his job it wasn't his fucking job exactly he was carrying him into a playoff picture and he did
um yeah I mean you pretty much hit it I mean what Patrick Kane's still doing though right now is
remarkable uh i think that
dylan larkin should say a prayer every night the fact that i'm not his agent because i was he's
worth every goddamn penny if not it looks like he probably should have got a million dollars per year
more as how as to how valuable he is to that team and including like obviously what he can do for
to brink it um heat daddy's been saying it from the mountaintops. And I agree the fucking,
to put the ad on the Jersey when you're on a heater and to also put it on a,
on a,
on a Jersey as beautiful as the Detroit Red Wing Jersey.
There should,
I don't mind the milk on the Leafs.
I'm telling you.
I,
okay.
That's fair.
That's fair.
But I personally, given the fact that what these original six franchises are worth, do we really need to put a fucking tramp stamp on a rocket?
That's what it is.
It's a tramp stamp.
Those things are iconic.
You look at an original six hockey jersey. It's stunning. The Red Wings jersey, I would honestly, I think the Chicago Blackhawks jersey is voted every year like best jersey.
I would put the red Detroit Red Wings jersey at right neck and neck with it.
It is stunning.
And to see that, it's just kind of like, oh, fuck.
And we can also get into the fanatic stuff with the fact that they're probably going to be
baking these things next year moving forward.
But Adidas, the Adidas has done a tremendous job
with the quality of these jerseys.
I personally find that the timing of putting that on there,
insane.
You don't fuck with the juju.
What do you think Crosby would have said
if they were on a heater
and all of a sudden there was an ad on his jersey?
He probably would have stopped it.
It's more about the timing, you're saying.
The timing.
More about the timing of it.
The timing.
In a garbage company?
And what happens?
You fucking play like garbage and lose to the Coyotes.
No offense, Coyotes fans.
Twice.
Who fucking hadn't won a hockey game since Christ was a cowboy.
Like, pathetic.
And once it Pledged.
The other thing that I saw mentioned
kind of swirling around Red Wings Twitter was
the lack of moves at the deadline.
If, like, they're wondering if, like,
the guys were almost, like, kind of bummed about that.
But I'm not saying even if they were,
they have a reason to shit the bed.
You got to be a pro and show up.
But that's just something where it's like,
oh, are we going to add anything?
No, not really.
So then that's like another question mark
in terms of where the season's going.
But as Eisenman did last year
when Ottawa curb stomped him twice,
he's like, fuck you.
Before the deadline, I'm not doing shit.
Well, maybe he still thought in his head,
I don't know what this team has.
I don't necessarily believe in this team quite yet.
And he didn't do anything.
And then the Coyotes curb stomp him twice.
So it's one of those things where right now,
I don't know if they're going to get in.
I don't know if those websites that have the odds,
if you want to look up their odds right now.
Well, we're not going to Pasha's website
to look up the fucking analytics
on whether they're going to make playoffs.
I'll accept that.
Listen, they're not out of it.
There's still a chance.
There's still tons of game left, but it's the fucking wild card, baby.
And that's why we're talking about it.
And I'm a little bit more positive about the fact, and I'll never, ever, ever from here on out,
bitch about the point structure of the NHL regular season.
You will never mark it down, clip it.
You have my word.
We're never bitching.
And I apologize to the league.
This is an amazing race going down the stretch.
Every game matters.
There was barely any doldrums of the season this year.
And we're completely invested in this.
Now, R.A., who are the other teams that we need to talk about in this wildcard?
Real quick, Whit, it was a 29 chance for them
to make the playoffs as of two days ago,
according to moneypuck.com. It was in the
70s or 80s before
that. So they've
really squandered this opportunity. Now, let's
hear what you got, R.A. Yeah,
with the jerseys, they lost their first
seven, currently one and nine with the garbage
patch on the jersey.
It's a tramp stamp.
I'm glad.
Can you just pay back priority and be like, all right, we're taking them off.
I wonder if the sponsorship surpasses the dollars that they would have made on playoff revenue.
That's what I want to know.
Even if it was just two games at home, I want to know what they made to get the garbage patch on there.
Then we can talk.
Moving along.
Garbage patch.
Go fucking tap.
Yeah, Tampa Bay Lightning.
We got to talk about those boys.
They beat the Florida Panthers Saturday in sunrise.
They picked up points in seven of nine games.
They got 78 points in 67 games.
Right now, Tampa has a 98.7 chance of making the playoffs
per the fine folks at money puck.
Dude,
Vassie,
his numbers,
not great.
Not what we used to see with him,
but it's Vassie,
man.
What's the playoff start.
I mean,
you can't count this team out because I feel like people might even be
underestimating Tampa a little bit.
Uh,
just because there's so many other,
other teams at Vassie.
I would imagine that Coop's reminding them every day,
walking in the locker room,
like nobody fucking believes in you
and just motivating the shit out of them.
You said it, Vazzy hasn't been up
to what we're used to seeing.
Guy, the amount of hockey he's played
in the last four years is like an eight-year load.
So if he's able to find his form,
and this might be-
Eight-year load, that reminds me. All right.
I was just saying,
I think I got one of those white buddy.
Fuck you.
I can't even think of my train of thought.
Oh,
um,
Oh,
and the other positive note,
and maybe I'm being too optimistic is Sergeyev four weeks after surgery is
back skating,
no equipment,
just in the tracks,
get Cito kind of buzzing around
out there slowly but if they're able to fucking make the first round and maybe even get past that
maybe this guy's a wolverine we've seen them before sometimes these guys it'll be a five
five month uh recovery time in two and a half months they're on the ice ready to go it's like
what the fuck were they doing behind the scenes? I don't know.
Maybe he sent them back over and got them on the gas.
I don't know.
But this guy could be ready to play.
Is there anything else that steps out from Tampa Bay, Witt?
Yeah, in terms of when R.A. said,
are they kind of not being appreciated or discussed enough?
I'm one of them.
I haven't really thought of them at all when I think of the East. I think of Florida. I think of the Rangers in Carolina. I don't even really have the Bruins
on that level. I think those are the three best teams in the East. But Tampa Bay, I was looking
at it today. But if you give me Kucherov, Point, Hedman, Stamkos, Sorelli, and Hagel,
Point, Hedman, Stamkos, Sorelli, and Hagel.
Like, buddy, that is an absolute wagon of a top six players, okay?
And then you got Nick Paul, like, as a great third-line center.
This Radish is playing great on D.
He's running the second power play.
Their first power play, Hedman.
Hedman's with Yossi.
Yossi's even above him, but they're the most quietly dominant defenseman of this season. You wonder if he can sustain this load for as long as he has.
Hedman's been unreal this year.
Yeah, it's a huge kick in the dick for him with Sergeyev being out.
But yeah, they get in.
Man, first, put it this way.
If you're getting whoever's scrounging around that eighth spot,
all these teams playing like trash.
Well, you look at the other top team, whoever finishes second,
they get the lightning.
That's kind of a panic.
So that's a race for first in the Eastern Conference, right?
Would you like to see the Battle of Florida again?
Oh, I want that.
I don't think that's the Pan of Florida again? Oh, I want that. I don't think the Panthers necessarily.
The Panthers don't.
Saturday night, buddy, the Panthers actually played really well,
but Tampa got them.
And that's just about, when they played before,
like that interstate rivalry, I think the league would love that.
I think the fan bases would love that.
I think that would be awesome.
But Florida doesn't want that to happen.
No way.
Buddy, I honestly don't think they want them or the Islanders.
And the reason I say that is if it wasn't for-
I think Florida would truck the Islanders.
Buddy, here's where I disagree with you.
They have 15 overtime or shootout losses this year.
They're a great five-on-five, like, regular playing hockey team.
If it wasn't for overtime and shootouts, three-on-three overtime,
they would easily be in a playoff spot.
Can I counterpoint your ass right now?
They have almost just as many losses in shootout and overtime
as they have regularization losses.
They're like maybe five games off, maybe seven at the most.
The Bruins might end up with more overtime losses
than regulation losses this year.
Can I counterpoint your ass?
Sure.
Yeah.
You know Florida's power play?
Oh, yeah.
You know how it's pretty good?
Yeah.
How Reinhardt has more power play goals than half the league?
Yeah.
The Islanders have the worst penalty kill in the nhl by a mile
yeah perfect time you get them in the playoffs dude with that power play buzzing it around
yeah and the islanders skating around like me in edmonton that will be a quick series unless
sorokin completely stands on his head and i don't want this to be Islanders bashing. One, I'm rooting for the Islanders to get in.
Just Patrick Waugh.
Oh, no, Paddy Waugh took care of that.
Whatever you say is just like nothing.
Paddy Waugh had a great Paddy Waugh moment.
He's sick and tired of seeing.
He's like, you're going into a big game,
and you're going to fucking lay eggs like that?
Like, he is. And he can talk the talk, and he can walk the walk.
He's done it before.
So I don't know if we want to hop off over to the Islander land quite yet,
R.A., but Tampa, they've risen to the occasion.
Absolutely.
Did you see that clip of Patrick Waugh last week?
A dude right behind the bench had a Patrick Watt T-shirt on,
and he scratched the park farm, threw it over the glass.
Pretty cool little thing.
You don't usually see Patrick Watt be all warm and fuzzy.
A nice little clip.
Well, he is until his fucking team lays a couple eggs on him.
Four in a row, correct?
I think they've lost four in a row.
You're the fucking host.
Take the reins and drive us to the Islanders, baby.
He's horny, for Christ's sake, bitch.
Come on, man.
Use that built-up sperm to fucking drive our bus, baby.
Let's go, baby.
I'm snipped.
Yeah, they had a six-game heat.
I put them right back in the wild card race in the Metro as well,
but they took a bit of a stumble, dropped the next four.
They got 73 points in 67 games, a point behind the Wings.
They do have a game in hand.
Three points behind Philly with the game in hand so they could get either in that third
spot or the wild card there he is
holy fuck baby give him
a sniffer that a boy
10-8 and 4 under Patrick Watt
but Biz do you think they end up getting
in the playoffs are they going to be one of the top eight teams
in the east yes
I think they're going to make playoffs and I think
that they're going to be dangerous
based on this, like I said.
So the argument right now between the fan base
is that the Sorokin, right?
Some people are trying to blame Sorokin
when they're having the same amount of breakdowns
defensively as last year,
which maybe Sorokin's not playing like a super freak.
So now all of a sudden it's like, well, we're not getting the same Sorokin's not playing like a super freak. So now all of a sudden it's like,
well, we're not getting the same Sorokin we did last year.
It's like, well, yeah, this guy went alien mode.
Now he's like maybe just a top tier goalie
with like, you know, good, good, solid numbers,
but he's not making those 10 bell saves,
but yet you're still having the same breakdown.
So maybe put a little bit of onus on the team
and the players in which I feel like Paddy Waugh is doing.
And I feel like that little spruce will get them going.
I do.
And you have to imagine at some point,
they go through these spurts of time
where they don't produce any type of offense.
They don't really have,
they're kind of like Colorado last year
where they don't really have a ton
outside of their top scoring.
They need to get that depth scoring back.
They always have to win the games 2-1.
And if they have any hope of hell of being dangerous,
yes, Shorokin's going to have to stand on his head.
But you have to imagine a first ballot Hall of Famer and a champion calling out his team after this recent stretch
will have to galvanize them, my favorite word as of late,
to not only a playoff position,
to at least put up
a fight against a team in which now you're playing against playoff rules not overtime three on three
and not the shootout nonsense five on five hockey so the islanders i believe will be dangerous
and that's my fucking opinion regardless of wit hitting me with the analytics like Pasha.
I've said my piece.
I kind of just mean against Florida, but in terms of like depth players and fans maybe not thinking they matter a ton,
I was talking to Borelli.
Buddy, they could use Bertuzzo back there.
Bobby, you know Bertuzzo.
That's just a veteran guy tough in front of that might help the PK.
I guess he's day-to-day, but
in looking for reasons
why this team's struggling so much,
yeah, it's like you
cannot rely on your goalie no matter how
good he is. But I do
think with what they did on that little
run, it's been a tough goal.
They still have a game against the Blackhawks.
They got a game against the Blue Jackets.
They got a game against the Flyers.
So in the end, I think that they're going to be controlling their own destiny, right?
I know right now, they don't sit in a playoff spot right now, correct?
Not right now.
Not right now.
Not at the moment.
But they do control their own destiny, though.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, well, actually, controlling their own destiny is the Capitals.
Can we go to this team?
Yeah, we're going to switch over,
but just going back really quick to Sorokin,
like he's got a 9-10 save percentage
and three goals against average,
where the goals against over his career is 2.5.
So that's where he's getting hit.
But if you're getting 9-10,
you're getting solid goaltending at 9-10.
9-20, now you're really talking.
So this isn't a bad goaltending issue.
This is a mojo issue.
And you know who doesn't have an issue with the mojo?
Like you just said, the Washington fucking Capitals,
the biggest anomaly in the National Hockey League.
It's an anomaly.
I don't know how this is happening.
They have 120 fucking goal score.
They're bottom five in scoring.
They don't really have any fucking superstars other than Ovi.
Who's really not playing like one.
I think he just had his 19th,
but they're riding completely off of Carberry, the new coach,
the young guys in the lineup,
and it is just a straight-up fucking mojo.
It is wild, Biz.
The goal differential at negative 30.
So there's five teams that have a worse one.
Columbus, Montreal, Anaheim, Chicago, and San Jose.
And of those five teams, the Habs are the closest to a playoff spot.
13 points behind the second wildcard. So the fact that Washington is right in the mix still is absolutely insane.
And I mentioned before.
Hey, Ari, on that note real quick,
Elliott said on 32 Thoughts that a team has never made the playoffs.
A team with a minus 24 goal differential is the highest goal differential of all time.
They're at minus 30.
So that's pretty crazy.
It's wild.
It makes no sense.
If you look at the team numbers.
Charlie Lindgren's their goalie.
None of it makes sense.
He's the reason where they are right now with, I think.
He's come out of nowhere.
I know.
I know.
You've got to give him credit.
But looking at the season, to miss the playoffs last year and then see what they had coming back this year,
and then to make the deals with no Kuznetsov.
He's gone.
Manta's gone.
Who else did they lose?
They lost the third guy they traded.
Who else did they deal with at the deadline?
There's another guy.
But somehow they're sticking in it.
And all I keep thinking about in terms of trying to explain it
is do you remember that clip that went somewhat viral?
It was after a game where John Carlson had hit a milestone.
I think Tom Wilson got announced as an all-star,
and somebody else was bleeding from blocking a shot,
and it was Carberry talking to these guys,
and it just seemed like the group was so close.
It seemed like the team loved each other,
and maybe that's what it is,
where they're somehow, some way,
getting points in games that they have no business getting.
I mean, dude, they get waxed by Edmonton.
Shout out my boy, Connor Brown.
Gets his first of the year.
What a story.
But they get waxed by Edmonton, and then you're like,
oh, they're going into Vancouver Saturday night.
They somehow beat the Canucks 2-1.
You know why?
Why?
Because Ovi was at the Greek getting
gooned up with all the locals he was they were having a time in Vancouver I think hey so if
Pasha is behind the scenes I think Pasha saw him out and when he scored in that game against
Vancouver the bench erupted like they'd won the Stanley Cup like it was like how is he even
skating let alone scoring after what he's doing.
I just think that you couldn't pick a team who's playing more with the
house's money.
And they're just absorbing every single moment of it.
I was the only one on the podcast who had them making playoffs.
I pulled that one out of my ass.
Cause if you would ask me halfway through,
if I could have changed my pick on one team,
I would have said Washington
because I was looking at all of their underlying numbers
being like a moron like Pasha.
So why don't we get him on and talk about
maybe him running an Ovi
and him not going up and saying anything for the first time
or is he not here?
He's up here.
He popped it.
What do you have to say for yourself, buddy?
You happy to be back?
Yeah, I would just like to say thank you to
Kim Jong-Bisman for lifting my suspension.
If that scumbag Matt Rempe got four games
for that dirty hit, I think four episodes.
Pasha, talk about Ovi for Christ's sake.
Yeah, no, I was just on a patio the other day
in the L-Town and who do you know
stumbles by Ovi and the guy was just absolutely in one, just cruising around.
Was this day before the game or two days before?
He deserves it.
This was day before the game, day before the game.
The sun was out in Vancouver.
Everyone was in a good mood, and Ovi was having a few.
It's not like he's that recognizable.
Yeah, exactly.
He was laying low, real low.
Why didn't you go up and say
hello you didn't want to go dab him up or was he getting hounded he was with jt miller so he
couldn't go over there yeah they were chumming it up eating ice cream with the enemy a coach
not just one of those things you know i don't want to pay him some respects and don't want to
swarm him like a super fan you know if he was on the devils i'd probably go up and say something
but uh just let the guy do his thing were people hounding him yeah oh yeah every single person that walked
by just like their heads cranked looking back you could see them talking is that obi that's obi and
a couple guys went up to him took photos from what i saw so yeah i think people would be biz
you know how when we've run into people they're always like surprised at our height like every
time we meet people like oh you guys are taller than I thought.
Ovi, if any of you people
listening could see this guy, you would
be shocked at the size of him.
He is a brick shithouse.
He is a brick shithouse.
He's a unit, as they say.
It's crazy that he used to move the way he did
being such a unit.
Look at the video of him playing
soccer last summer.
I think it was like Putin's charity
soccer game
to raise funds for more
missiles.
Wasn't he like botting guys?
He was driving them to raise money
for the gold card that they all get to go
fucking do bot
to bot the service.
Anyway.
Weren't you away recently? I saw online were you partying somewhere oh yeah i was down in la visiting my cousins and it uh happened to be
oscars weekend so managed to go to a couple fun parties and uh yeah he said that you were at the
three best oscar parties going on that weekend what are you trying to do bag lick leo
i didn't end up going to that third one him and i were talking about but yeah two very very good
parties la knows how to throw a good party and uh yeah leo was that one of them but uh you know
leo your underlying numbers in your last film weren't exactly great for the future of your
acting career you know what i said said no no let this one breathe
no let that one breathe come on get this guy off get this guy off oh no no actually you don't know
let that joke breathe you pasha quickly loser what were the what were all the numbers about
detroit that you were ranting and raving about once they started losing oh just like all like
the the standard numbers like their shot generation, shot suppression.
It was all just very bland.
It was just like, settle down, Derek.
What?
Shot suppression.
Hey, hey. Okay.
Okay. R is load suppression
and the red ring shot suppression.
It's the story of the
chick episode. Hey, there's only one
fucking Nostradamus on this podcast,
and it's fucking me calling Dreisaitl's goals.
Now, since you know all these underlying numbers,
who are the real frauds in the NHL right now?
You think you know because you look at these fucking charts
that you're going to call your shot right now.
Who's the next team?
Who's considered a cup contender that in Pasha's eyes
have zero chance based on the underlying stats?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Save Vancouver.
No, no.
Kyle Dubas over here.
No, I would say the teams that are truly considered contenders, the Colorados, the Dallases, the Vegases.
Those guys are all legit.
Those guys are legit.
Edmonton.
Edmonton.
Yes, yes.
Edmonton.
Yes.
Oh, Jesus.
Crime dog McGruff over here. Edmonton. Edmonton, yes. Yes, Edmonton, yes. Oh, Jesus. Crime dog McGruff over here.
Sherlock fucking Holmes.
The cap circumcisors are good, eh?
They're playing with 10 million over the cap,
and they got fucking down the middle.
Down the middle, they're more loaded than the All-Star team in the East this year.
Anyway, any other gems for us, Pasha?
What was your thought on the whole the whole uh uh devil's picking
up mcdermott well let's why don't we hop there quick and then we're gonna pigeon toss you uh
devil's picking up my derma too little too late the guy sucks he takes too many penalties i'll
say this about the devils before i go i'll say this by the devil you're a piece of shit it's
fucking done the season's cursed they got fucked with injuries it's over they should shut Jack down and get him the treatment he's got to get.
Lifeless performances.
They need a new coach.
They need a goalie.
They got, what, 14 games left?
I hope they no-show for all 14 games.
It's time to Houdini for Celebrini.
Pack it in.
The season's over.
Get this guy off the fucking screen.
He's wanting Celebrini now?
Who do you need for Celebrini, baby?
Oh, my God.
I was at the BU playoff game this weekend.
Quarterfinals, Hockey East against Northeastern.
Northeastern made it 3-2.
I'm like, oh, my God.
It's a panic.
It was 3-0 at one point.
And what do you know?
This Celebrini kid goes down with one of the best goals he's had all season.
Pulled a rabbit out of his ass.
That's like a true game breaker.
Like, this kid.
I was actually sitting with Shani at the game for a while.
Oh.
He was there.
He was there.
The Leafs traded for this big defenseman, Cade Weber, on BU.
It was kind of a small, quiet move.
He said he was playing college, and I think Shani wanted to see him.
Buddy, this guy's going to play in the NHL.
He's about 6'7", maybe even taller.
I think he might have broken the record
or is on pace to break the record for shots blocked in a career in NCAA
or one season.
I'm not exactly sure.
But I was just talking with Shani,
and even he was like, this kid, this kid.
Was that a Dubas parting gift?
Was that a Dubas draft pick?
It wasn't picked by the Leafs.
They just traded for him.
They just got him.
I thought maybe it was a Dubas parting gift.
I don't know who drafted him.
Wait, I had one more quick one.
It was for, it was about.
Thanks for the call, Shani.
The bet.
Okay, so you're saying shut Jack down because of the injury component.
I agree.
A wasted season.
You might as well get as good of a draft picked as possible.
Now, you have one year left on this bet now with Witt.
He was willing to buy out of it for a very high number at one point.
That's correct.
What would your buyout number be?
What was the original bet?
It was 3,000, correct?
Yep.
For he had three years to hit the 100-point mark.
He got 99 last year.
Which was such a bad bet.
It was such a bad bet.
For you.
But in the end, somehow, I'm somewhat...
Here's the thing.
If he stays healthy, he's smashing it.
Two years ago, last year, this year, and it would be next year.
And that's why I wanted to buy out of it. Because, one, I love watching the guy play.hing it. Two years ago, last year, this year, and it would be next year. And that's why I wanted to buy out of it.
Because, one, I love watching the guy play.
He's dynamic.
He's exactly what you love seeing in this new NHL.
And two, I don't want to root, and I still would not root for somebody to be injured.
So I think I offered him, did I offer you two grand?
2,400, yeah. I offered him 2,400. Did I offer you two grand? 2,400, yeah.
I offered him 2,400 bucks, dude, and he wouldn't take it.
So now he deserves to lose.
But what does your chart say about not taking that deal?
I'm fully confident.
You know, he's got one more season left.
He's going to smash it next year.
I'm going to collect the full 300.
I'm riding it out.
Three grand.
Final buyout offer final final buyout offer
final buyout offer with no i can't this yeah actually 500 bucks no sir we're gonna ride this
one out the worst thing about this guy is you make a bet with a friend get rid of them you make a bet
with a friend and it's three thousand dollars and then at one point i'm like all right dude i'll
just give you 2400 it's 600 like i i i said that thinking point I'm like alright dude I'll just give you 2,400 it's 600 like I
said that thinking he'd be like okay great and he's
like no I'm like you motherfucker
like oh that's 600
so now it's like I don't really even want to
do it at all I do because I just want to
like root for the kid but in the
end we'll see I mean I
never would have thought that it was going to end up
getting to year three the way he
played last year before his injury.
And then this year, I'm like, he'll beat it.
And then he got injured again.
So I don't know.
So they're out of the East wild card.
And it was a nice little pop in from our boy Pasha.
Now, let's talk about the Rempe and McDermott hit later.
All right, let's stick with this wild card race.
We still have one more team left, don't we?
Shoot, shoot.
Oh, Jesus Christ. No, I don't want to cough on the mic. That should go good on a Thursday. Oh, I thought you had a wet dream't we? Shoot, shoot. Oh, Jesus Christ.
I thought you had a wet dream.
Fell asleep there when we were talking to Pasha.
Sooner or later, the freebie
will come. We got to give props to
TJ Oshie, played his 1,000th game the other night.
How hilarious.
I said that clip, the pregame ass
smacks. The Capitals love fucking whacking each other with
the sticks and falling down and yelling. That fucking
thing was hilarious. Oshie, man, great American player, great guy to root for whacking each other with the sticks and falling down and yelling. That fucking thing was hilarious. But Oshie, man, just great American player.
Great guy to root for.
Obviously, a guest on the show a few years back, a hilarious guest.
He termed the big dogs, all the players he knows in the league.
I think he knew about 20 of the players in the league.
But Osh, great job.
Congrats on the 1,000th game and good stuff.
Any pot and thoughts?
Yeah, just a guy who's battled through some concussion stuff too,
and some,
some injuries and a great to see him get a thousandth.
I mean,
a guy who's going to be an American icon based on the stuff that
happened at show Sochi with the shootouts.
And yeah,
he's just a great dude,
extremely well liked and beloved by his teammates.
So couldn't,
couldn't have happened to a better guy with,
and just sprinkling a little bit more mojo for that Caps team.
Yep.
I didn't see what they got him for a gift,
but when I think of him, it's just like plays the game the right way.
Like has always been so physical.
That's with some of the injuries he's dealt with,
but just goes to the net hard, runs people over,
dominant everywhere he's ever played.
Shattuck, St. Mary, wherever.
Junior.
No, he didn't went to Shattuck.
I don't think he did.
I think he went to one of those schools.
Maybe he did.
I know he played at War Road.
He played at War Road High School.
And now he's got his clothing brand, War Road.
He's making those neck guard and wrist guards in one shirt.
He's doing awesome with that.
Then he goes to North Dakota.
He's dominant. Then he goes to St Dakota. He's dominant. Then he goes
to St. Louis. So exciting. Sick hands.
Unreal on shootouts. Runs people
over, like I said. He played in
the USHL for a year, too. He played
in the USHL for Sioux Falls
one year before going to North Dakota.
Just a great guy. I know we say
this a lot, but there's just that many good people
in the game, and he's one of them. It's
awesome to see when guys that deserve
to play that long and play that many games
reach their goal. I'm happy
for him. Congrats, Osh. A couple
clicks for TJ Oshie, ladies and gentlemen.
Great golfer. Plays in that
celebrity
classic in Tahoe.
He's got the world by the balls, that guy. Good looking
cat. Nice hair. He's so
handsome. Beautiful family. He's got it all. Huge wrench, probably guy. Good-looking cat. Nice hair. Oh, he's so handsome. Beautiful family.
He's got it all.
Huge wrench, probably.
I haven't seen it.
I would assume.
It's like a weapon.

The Buffalo Sabres biz.
They had a 5-1 run a couple weeks ago.
They got right back in the playoff mix.
They had a little stumble lately, cooled off a bit.
69 points in 68 games.
They're five points back in the wildcard.
I mean, I don't know if they're going to get in or not,
but we got to talk about Bowen Byron, man.
What a fucking shot he's been for that team.
Three goals in his first three games there.
First defenseman ever to do it in Buffalo Sabres history.
His time of ice right here, 1950, when he was out in Colorado,
he went up to 24.42.
So his time of ice went up almost five minutes a game.
Eight times eight.
Give it to him. Eight times eight. Eight times eight. Give it to him.
Eight times eight.
82-82 to the 46.
Give it to him.
It seems that that deal's working out great for both sides.
Yeah.
Because Middlestead's done well with Colorado, and he's playing phenomenal in Buffalo.
Unreal clip of him on the bench talking about Darlene with Tage Thompson.
I don't know if you guys saw that.
No, I didn't.
He's like, this guy
doesn't get tired. And Tage
Thompson's like, no, we do this bike test
before camp. Everyone can't even
move after they're laying down on the ground
for 15 minutes. And he just gets up
and walks away. And he's completely
fine with the best score. He'll
play 30 minutes tonight. He won't
break a sweat. He's just a
freak. So going back in a lifetime of horrible takes by yours truly,
the Darlene for Drysdale and Ziegler's trade,
I mean, I'll never live that one down.
I owe another apology.
Ever.
And I have so many of them, but I'll never live that down.
Apologize again to the Buffalo Sabres and their fans.
But Byram is just, I think'll never live that down. Apologize again to the Buffalo Sabres and their fans. But Byram
is just, I think it's the whole
thing. Like, alright, five minutes
more per game. Buddy, that
is so much confidence
that's just kind of
put right into your system.
You're feeling the puck that much more. You have
a way bigger role. You feel better about
yourself. You feel better about your game.
And the whole time, he's probably thinking I I could do this. If I'm on any other team,
I'm playing 23 to 25 minutes a game. And he's getting his chance. He's probably so happy.
It sucks going from a cup contender to a team that'll probably miss playoffs. But he's done
enough to at least somehow get them in the conversation. And you talk about the capital
season. If you look at all the numbers, save percentage, points within the roster,
Buffalo is the exact same team as Washington.
It's crazy how similar they are, but somehow Washington's above them
in this anomaly season that they're having.
But I guess Buffalo's not dead yet.
What's crazy is seeing T.H. Thompson's drop.
They're dead.
They're done.
I don't know.
The loss against Detroit. The Detroit loss was brutal for them. They're dead. They're done. I don't know. The loss against Detroit.
The Detroit loss was brutal for them.
That was it.
That could have probably been it.
But, hey, at least they're not completely out of it.
At least their fans have that little bit of hope.
I understand.
6 chance.
They got a 6 chance, man.
And for the 13th year in a row the longest active streak
in all of professional sports they will not make playoffs i don't right now i'll be optimistic
about it because that's the theme of the show but i don't want to hear the future's bright
because if they fucking come in the next season again but the thing that the bull byram
trade is done is it's kind of like at least reignited the fan base again saying like wow
okay now that we got him on the back end our team looks totally different and now going into next
season they're going to think the same fucking thing but there's still some work to be done here
they got to fill in the holes and you talked about t Tage Thompson's regression wit. What's up with that? I just think it's an off
year and he'll be right back to where he was beforehand. They had injuries
early on, a little bit of adversity. Quinn tore his Achilles and he was out
of the lineup. They're going to get a little bit older, but I don't know if I
want to hear the future's bright with this team until they actually fucking make the playoffs.
I've already made this mistake
once with the New Jersey Devils.
I think that
it would be surprising to
me if Don Granato's back.
I think this is his fourth year
and it just hasn't
changed. This was kind of that make or
break season in terms of coaching
wise and possibly making a move.
So I would be kind of surprised if
they do miss playoffs which it looks like they will if he's back there but as you say biz like
your roster's your roster so after what happened this offseason and in training camp and us ranting
and raving me me specifically about the sabers and this being the year or at least one of the
sabers or the senators and then this happening again, I'm with you.
I don't care how it looks in training camp.
I don't care how the exhibition games go.
Show me a team that come the new year next season is playing good hockey
and in the mix because you can play great in March all you want.
This always happens with certain teams.
They play great in March, and the fan base is like, okay, buddy,
those games in March now, at least they matter a little bit right now but too little too late too little
too late too little too late and another thing too is is their goaltending especially in the
second half of the season has definitely put a band-aid kind of like we talked about sorokin
how last year he was fucking standing on his head upl in the second half of the season has been
dominant his numbers are tremendous and that's
a big reason as to why so let's not that let that fool itself as far as granado i don't know if this
late season push and getting byram in there might save his job for one more season let's see how
things go maybe they improve the roster with adding some more uh some more sandpaper and get
filling in those holes a little bit better than they'd done this year. So I don't know.
I don't know,
but it's gotta,
it's gotta be something to get over the hump.
All right.
What would you pin that like failure this season off?
Like what went wrong?
So the,
the,
the,
the,
if they want to address something,
I think because of all that,
you know,
you watched them play and the little,
there's a i
would say there's pawn it looks like pawn hockey sometimes with is that fair i think they definitely
lack structure and what they lack jam dude they lack jam and they lacked a little bit of structure
and i think that they the way that they're you want to allow them creativity and fluidity in
their offense like that i think that that certain players, like you go down to Tampa and I feel like they allow that,
but there's other elements to their game where there is structure and there is
accountability.
Like,
I feel like if they want to try to address that,
maybe going out there and getting a coach like Berube who would help kind of
bring these younger players to that next level.
And then understanding that as well as honing those skills that they have in
order to become more complete players.
I don't know.
That would be probably be the one thing if I was an organization that I would
probably consider doing and no,
no disrespect to Granado.
I would even be okay if they gave them another year to see how with maybe some
better personnel where I agree with you.
I don't think that they're going to do that.
But I'm saying is with the trade that they just made,
allowing these younger guys to get one year more mature and filling in those
is a post.
So that leadership's gone.
Like who are they going to bring in to fill in the bottom lines and add that
sandpaper that,
that we talk about that they're missing,
where are they going to get it and go do it? If they we talk about that they're missing where are they
going to get it and go do it if they want to do that with don granato and give them one more chance
sure if they're going to move on to berube to try to hone these younger guys in to become more
complete players and they want to go that approach i understand and i'm just using berube as a name
i feel like that is what they would need that type of person who is going to be able to to to get that
through to these guys less pawn hockey more structure more reliability throughout the course
of an 82 game season i think that um in this new age of coaches salaries some of them making some
pretty legit dough craig barubi could end up getting a monster times four four times dude
i mean look at how many teams are going to be after that guy he might he's a little bit older Craig Berube could end up getting a monster contract. Four times four? Four times four. More, dude.
I mean, look at how many teams are going to be after that guy.
He's a little bit older.
I don't know how long he's going to want to coach.
That's the only thing.
Yeah, but, buddy, I don't think age matters.
If a team calls you and is like, hey, we'll give you a five-year deal
for fucking 30 million, 25 million.
Okay, wow, wow.
That's where the number  yeah.
My thing is he's so he's gonna
it it's just demand it's like being the number one free agent in a summer with not a lot of
free agents it's like there there are so many teams that would want that guy as head coach
that i think the other guys available do you think quinnville gets back in the mix
i i think he's gonna have to get my sense on that one is he has to kind of get out there
and say something before the league would even allow it.
Does that sound crazy to you?
No, I think that there's going to have to be a rehabilitation process
from getting a press release and just make sure you're handling it all the right way.
Or an interview.
I don't know.
He's going to get cleared by Bettman, basically.
Bettman's going to have to let him have the ability to coach again.
Yeah, it is a little strange.
I mean, I know the report come out.
I don't know that Joel Quenville did something that warrants him
not being able to coach at the NHL again.
So the one thing that's being held against him,
I know we're kind of off the rails completely,
and I don't mind being open and honest about what I hear
from these types of situations is there was a on a resume there was like a what do you call it like a
it was like a letter of recommendation letter of recommendation yeah for for the for the person
that had been involved in the kyle beach stuff now that that might be a fictional story or or
something that never actually came across his desk that he might be a fictional story or or or something that never actually came across
his desk that he might be like i have no involvement even in that i don't know how that
whole thing shook out so i don't know what's being held against joel quinville as to why he's not
being some people might say the fact that he heard that and didn't do something where he's like
he thought his superior was handling it that's why he like didn't didn't do something where he's like, he thought his superior was handling it. That's why he like didn't,
didn't do anything at that time.
So when this all came out and,
but Hey,
listen,
if there's a letter of recommendation there and he's involved in it,
I think that that would be once again,
the thing that would be being held against him right now for reinstatement.
I can't think of anything else that I've heard that would keep him from
coaching in the national Hockey League.
So other than him and Berube, wait, am I crazy?
Am I broken this down pretty good or what?
Yeah, pretty well.
And I think he was told right before the cup final,
yeah, without us being in that coach's room,
and it's kind of unfair of us to say what went on,
what he knew, what he didn't know, what he did do,
what he didn't do. It's just, what he did do, what he didn't do.
Like, it's just, in the end, it comes down to Bettman.
Now, the thing with hiring Quenville is that,
and whether this is right or wrong, I'm not one to say,
but owners and GMs, they're going to face backlash.
And it's online, it's fucking Twitter,
and it's like, do you care, do you not care?
But there's going to be some. So it's like, do you care? Do you not care? But there's going to be some.
So it's like, do people want to be in the mix if they could go out and grab a coach that they know they wouldn't have to deal with those headaches off the beginning?
Now, with all that bullshit and all that noise that will be made whenever Quenville gets a job again, if he does, once that team starts winning, do you think the fans are going to give two fucks?
Yeah.
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's definitely going to. And far yeah i think yeah well yeah it's
definitely gonna and i think it goes without saying anything we're talking about now is just
kind of like hypothetical and and assumptions and assuming that he would be rehired it's obviously
going to kick up that dust uh from from the whole kyle beach situation and we're not trying to be
insensitive to that either like that was a a terrible thing so i don't think we can move on last thing i will mention
about coaches involved with this wild card this wild wild card race in the east is i think carberry
is right in the mix for coach of the year i i guess you could say the team is like has this
horrible goal differential and they have no business being where they're at, but he's doing something right. They're winning games somehow.
So if they get in, he's in my final three.
Okay.
I was about to say that the coach of the year might have more candidates
that are deserving to win than the MVP race right now.
So you'd have Carberry.
You'd have Tortorella.
You'd have, I would assume, Rick Talkett.
You'd have to have Rick Bonus yep and who else it's hard to argue against lavia let like with the there's just yeah i mean
i guess when you look at maurice and lavia let like their rosters are so loaded
and and they were and they were good last year so it's a little different. Granted, Florida just snuck in last year.
But yeah, there's so many coaches that are deserving this season.
I think if Washington makes playoffs, I wouldn't be shocked if Carberry won it.
That's a fuck.
With that roster, right now, Ovi has, what, 19 goals?
So Dylan Strom's the only guy on the team with at least 20 tucks.
I think he's got 22 right now.
Yeah, he's leading the team in points just one other note on
the recommendation letter biz I don't
think there was an actual letter because I
read all those stories because I was like who the fuck gave this
guy one and I think they were like
sort of saying that the fact he was a name was
on the cup and they let his name on the cup
they were essentially endorsing him which
but I don't think an actual letter of recommendation
was ever written
that's why I said that's what I heard They were essentially endorsing him, but I don't think an actual letter of recommendation was ever written.
All right.
And that's what I heard,
and that was what I heard was kind of like what was being held against him, I guess, to the highest degree as to why he can't be reinstated
and work in the NHL anymore.
So I don't know.
We're just, like I said, speculating,
and maybe someone will come forward with that.
So we can move on.
We can move on.
How about those fucking Hurricanes, baby?
They picked up Jake Ensel, who's nets off immediate dividends.
Jake Ensel, he's got a goal and four assists in four games already.
He's nets off two goals, two assists in six games.
But I think the biggest factor right now for the Canes, Freddie.
Freddie Anderson was out most of the year.
He had that blood clot issue.
And the four games since he's been back,
4-0 with a 1-2-6 goals against,
9-4-9 save percentage,
a one shout out.
I mean, he played unbelievable
in the playoffs last year.
I think fucking Carolina's for real this year, Biz.
When I'm going to hand it over to you
because you've been double-wristing them nonstop,
this could be the year.
This could...
Koozie and the mojo with orlov and everything they got going
on the koozie storm surge buddy this team is so good and and and before i go into pumping them i
will pump the rangers the rangers went in there and there were some fabulous games around the
league this week yeah that rangers carolina game that the Rangers won 1-0
was one of the best games I've watched this season.
I guess that and Edmonton-Colorado this week were my 1-2.
There were some wild games everywhere,
but I need to see those teams play in the second round.
I need to see it happen because they just match up so well against each other.
I think that was Kochekov that night.
I think that was Kuchekov that night. I think.
But it was just,
the Rangers are 11-1 on back-to-backs this year.
They played the night before in New York,
flew down,
then got a huge gutsy win.
But let's go to Carolina.
We ranted and raved about their deadline.
Kuznetsov is just probably somebody,
when we talk about Byron being so excited to play that
much more dude times this by 10 he was on waivers he was in the minors and he gets this second
opportunity and he's just running with it like and it's not just like oh I'm back in the NHL I'm
happy to be here no dude when we need a goal at the end of the game I'm on the ice I'm playing
power play I'm playing my minutes are going up game. And he's just so generally happy based on his interviews.
The one with him and Orlov is hilarious.
You know, they were friends from Washington.
So he gets to have that, you know, he's familiar with him.
And he's obviously getting in with the team like right away.
They love having him.
Gensel is just another story.
He's got five points at four games.
He scored a beautiful goal in Ottawa.
It was a late goal, but still a snipe right over the goalie's glove. He's got four assists. He's got five points in four games. He scored a beautiful goal in Ottawa. It was a late goal, but still a snipe right over
the goalie's glove. He's got four assists.
He's playing with Ajo. Ajo's been
out of this world, which is kind of what
we mentioned, that Ajo's an unreal player.
We always said he wasn't a superstar,
but he's right on the cusp. Well, dude,
now you bring in a couple other game breakers
and he's even better. Teams
can't completely just focus on him.
He had two goals in that wild comeback.
I think he had both goals late in the game against the Leafs.
They came back and won that game in a shootout.
He had a gross assist to Jarvis yesterday in Ottawa.
Like just through the box, right on his stick, he buried it.
Jarvis immediately starts pointing them.
They have a mojo around that team.
They finally went out and made moves as we talked about the last two episodes.
And they are right up there
in top five cup contenders for me.
And having
Anderson...
Good call. I like that.
I like to use that tough call.
You got to wave your arms, though.
Wave your fucking arms. Yeah, there we go.
That looks like all right.
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.
All over their dick right now.
Jesus Christ, Whit.
This is a double stroke fest.
Because I was saying they need to bring people in,
and they brought two people in.
Even fucking Grinelli's about to bust his nut.
What do you want to chime in with about the fucking Hurricanes?
So interesting note about how that Kuznetsov signing all came to be.
So Elliott was talking about this on 32 Thoughts
where they went to Ajo, and they asked Ajo what his thoughts were.
And if,
cause obviously him being one of the leaders on the team,
they said,
Hey,
should we bring this guy in?
And he said,
you know,
I can't make this decision.
Let's ask Justin Williams.
And Justin Williams was kind of the guy that they went to.
He made the final call and said,
bring this guy in.
I guarantee you he'll help you.
And he's helping him.
He's helping.
Holy fuck.
That,
I, my half, i got a half chub
hockey boner right now that's when you know that's when you know that that is i guess you trust you
trust the leadership on your team to bring a guy in who's had some very questionable uh mistakes
in his career but you trust the leaders will be like buddy this is how we play this is how we do
things you're gonna do it and be a big part of this.
And if you don't, you're done.
Like, you just won't be a part of this team.
The maturity on Sebastian Ajo to say that and say, I think we should consult somebody who's like, that is just fucking what a guy, man.
The perfect guy to consult to Justin Williams, Mr. Game 7.
Just the ultimate locker room guy.
On the golf course, dude, draining birdie
putts. He made an eagle.
He's like, ah, I just eagled
the third. That's a good sign to bring in.
Ah!
Bring him in.
You've been on fire today.
Roasting Pasha with the
call!
What about I was walking through a Gannis
arena. Did you see Rob Brindamore postgame?
He goes, fuck, I used to hate that stupid bird thing you were doing
when you were playing in Washington, but boy, do I love it now.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Right in the postgame, it was fucking perfect.
They got the mojo.
Yeah, that's true.
Maybe he stole it from Washington and brought it there.
Maybe it's done.
I cut you off for the 20th time today.
What were you about to say?
You were walking around a Gannis?
Oh, fuck.
What a kick in the dick.
Shut up, Art.
I'm walking around a Gannis, and my wife's on the outside,
and she hears this guy say, is that Witt?
And his buddy goes, no, that guy looks way too old.
And I'm like, what?
And then the guy's like, no, it was.
And then I saw him later.
He's like, hey, can we take a picture?
And she's like, does he look that old?
And he's like, no, it's not as bad when you get a little closer to it.
Oh, yeah.
I'm like, fuck you, buddy.
I could have been worse.
That was brutal.
Oh, shit.
Aging like milk.
All right.

We, uh, we got an interview with a little bit.
Dossie Tucker, Toronto Maple Leafs pest from back in the day.
Awesome interview.
Hilarious guy.
He was thrilled to be on, which makes us thrilled to have somebody on.
But Chris Johnson, our buddy, had an interesting nugget for the GM meetings.
A couple managers said that the league has signed on to do a behind-the-scenes series with Amazon
that will center around 10 to 12 stop plays due for a fall release.
I'll go to you, G.
Who would you like to see on this show?
What do you mean we're going to G?
Yeah, people don't want to hear from me.
Go to Biz and win.
No, actually, G, you brought this up.
G's going to be like, oh, DeBrusque, McAvoy, Swayman,
a couple guys on the Bulls that won the Cup.
Yeah. In my head, I actually was going to be like,
say Marchand, say
Pasternak, and I knew that you would bury me for
saying that. That's why I kicked it back to you guys.
You said Netflix
originally, though, but this is Amazon
doing it. Now, had you heard of
any rumblings of them potentially
doing this? Yep. Yes,
I have. I've heard of I've heard that there were companies following guys around, pitching it to Netflix.
I don't want to say some of the guys' names, but I know there are a couple of guys that
have been getting followed around for two years now with hopes of this happening.
They've already been filming, guys?
Yes.
Yes, we can beep out his name, but I know they've been filming, guys? Yes. Yes, we can beep out his name,
but I know they've been filming for two years now.
Company is behind it.
Yeah, I talked to them.
I had a Zoom call with them, yeah.
So they did two or three. I think they did that player you mentioned,
and they had a couple other in mind, and it was good.
I've seen the footage. And was, uh, and the agreement is, is that it would eventually
never see the light of day until obviously everybody agreed on it. But I think that the
one with the player you mentioned was just kind of like them doing a mock, but it was so, it was
so good that I'm like, is he eventually going to give you clearance to use this because of the,
the amount of, I don't want to say turmoil, but how cool the story has been since the time they've been following them.
So you're telling me that they've done more players than just.
Yes.
Yes, I can tell you that.
So all that.
It would just have to be the player that agrees to have that come out.
So I don't know how that works in that sense.
But yeah, like I will say side one that what
they're what when the players are given this type of access obviously the concern concerns becomes
how am i going to be portrayed and when i watched the one with the player you mentioned i was like
he has to love how this is like came out it's like it's it's amazing right so are you saying
that they've already done those other 11 players no no no no okay it's like it's it's amazing right so are you saying that they've already done those other 11
players no no no no no okay it's in the same situation as where they have been filming with
the hopes that a netflix and amazon someone would come in and buy this and then they're like whoa
we have two years of back footage of this guy in case one as a mock as a case sample and two if you
want to go back and use this footage,
just in case you do something.
But I'm asking you, so they haven't done,
they said up to 12 players.
They haven't done anything even prior
on any of those potential players.
It would essentially start around now.
Yeah, I have no knowledge of that,
but I know this is supposed to release next year.
So they're saying it's supposed to release next fall.
So there's no way they're not already filming this. Okay, so
now we can actually name names
and speculate as to who we would want and who
we think they'll pick. If they don't do
McDavid's run to the
potential Stanley Cup right now, then this
is a complete miss. Well, it's funny though.
I was just going to say, I don't know if you want
somebody who's going to give you nothing.
Because you need guys who are willing to do this, Biz.
You need guys who are willing to talk to the cameras.
Buddy, but if you have full creative control
and if he doesn't like the way it ends up being portrayed,
it never sees the light of day.
When it's private access,
these guys show a side of themselves
and there's so much footage they might draw out the
intensity in which he's like trying to capture his first cup how serious and how how regimented it is
that to me is captivating it doesn't the personality aspect is that's his fucking personality
he is a fucking slave to a stanley cup so you would go for the best players as opposed to interesting guys.
No, you give a little bit of it all.
That's the beauty of it.
I would want to see, you know who I would want to see?
I want to see Brent Burns.
Trevor Zegers had a very difficult year this year with injury.
He had the fucking drama of the contract.
How does Trevor Zegers bounce back?
And on top of that, with the personality and access
that you're going to be able to get from him
on the West Coast,
that to me is one of your guys.
Obviously, you said it on the last podcast, G,
when you kind of brought up the Netflix idea to begin with.
Ovi on his pursuit to the gold chase is a no-brainer.
Yep.
Imagine if they
were filming Sid this year and
you got to go through the process of trading
Gensel and how angry he's been and the direction
of the Penguins. Which direction are they going?
They're filming meetings with him and Dubas.
I don't know if that would ever happen,
but that would be incredible,
incredible content. And to the McDavid
point, I think McDavid's one of those
guys that you have
you can't do this project without connor mcdavid i just feel it's too big it's amazon you have to
have connor but but you come for connor you stay for mckinnon you come for connor you stay for the
guys i think you stay for it all i think you're gonna get such a difference of of uh i mean
mcdavid's the this generation's gretzky like if if his approach
guys in today's nhl like yes i'm not saying it's cool because like back in the day they were like
wayne was able to do it and he was going out and slamming pops with the boys like that's what makes
him the great one it's insane it doesn't make sense but nowadays in order to be that guy you have to be fucking diet no alcohol
sleeping your whatever hours all the outside bullshit you are completely separated from the
world other than dialed into your to whatever you got going on now going going i mean fuck we were
cooking base keep going with guys that you want to see you mentioned z grace you've mentioned
mcdavid is there any other names i think brad marshand would be great just off the top of my We were cooking. Keep going with guys that you want to see. You mentioned Z grace. You've mentioned McDavid.
Is there any other names?
I think Brad Marchand would be great.
Just off the top of my head,
but I don't know about you guys.
Jack Hughes,
I think would be another one.
That would be incredible.
Artemi Panarin in New York city.
Nikita Zdorov.
A Russian defenseman.
He's got quite a personality on him.
We had him on the show before.
I think he'd be great on that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
I lean toward what you're saying
with guys that have personality.
Biz, you're right. You need to have
both. You can't just have guys who are
non-superstars.
You need a couple of them.
Follow a fighter.
Follow if Rempe's up all year
next year, the
nerves and the butterflies
or what he has to experienced being a new heavy
weight in the national hockey league knowing that you got ryan reeves licking his chops oh then
you're flying over to montreal you got the canadian swing oh my god wi-fi that's that is a that is a
component to our game and the emotion and and the build-up of what i would like to see that
differentiates them get delorier if you want to get more of a veteran.
I'd really like to see Rempe just because of the fact of,
I'd like to see the process of guys getting sent up and going down.
This doesn't necessarily need to be all NHL players.
Obviously, they're going to be the biggest draw,
but a guy like Rempe is going to be a big draw regardless of the left.
Jacki, Arbor Jacki, Wi-Fi as well.
He was up and down this year and then he
was fighting every game in the american league so i agree with you g like showing that component
and and they've done a good job in the past through the documentaries when they were
following actually speaking to aves when when they were following around uh detroit he was kind of
that guy when they were pursuing their family cup who was the call up and down guy so you got to
kind of see him coming with the gear.
Leave, oh, hey, we're sending you down.
So yeah, I know our wheels are spinning right now
as to who they could get, but great conversation.
Glad to see that they're doing it.
And this is what hockey needs in order to bring itself
to the next level.
And then it goes without saying,
you got to get Matthews or Nylander
or somebody else, Leafs involved.
Oh, they'll have a Leaf.
They'll have a Leaf.
But I think no matter who they pick, this is a win.
I think no matter who the 11-12 guys are, all hockey fans are going to want to tune in.
Depending on how many guys they use, I guess they said 11 or 12, but you have all these different storylines.
And I enjoy full swing.
Now, granted, it's a little bit of kind of explaining golf.
Like it's produced for people who maybe don't follow golf,
which I'm sure will be kind of similar in hockey
where they're going over things,
trying to get viewers that don't know anything about the game.
But in the end, just seeing players' personal lives,
and golf's even a different animal because you're alone.
You're alone with your thoughts.
You're alone with your reactions.
And you're alone with everything. You have nobody to lean on besides, I guess, your cad. You're alone with your thoughts. You're alone with your reactions and you're alone with everything.
You have nobody to lean on
besides, I guess, your caddy or your wife
or your parents.
But hockey, like being on a team
and being able to have these guys around
throughout pregame meals
and in the locker room after a loss
or in the locker room after a big win,
that's what will create like unreal content
and hopefully a great show.
And ultimately, the way you're going to get the best stuff is just getting their trust.
Make sure that they enjoy the way they're being portrayed,
and then other guys can see that and be like,
well, I want them made to have looked that good.
And another thing, I think if you get one guy,
the dominoes will fall.
If McDavid hears that McKinnon's doing it,
and maybe Crosby's doing it and maybe crosby's doing
it and the big guys i think he's gonna not want to feel left out and and and show people yeah yeah
maybe you don't think i my personality's shining bright i'm fucking focused on other shit here
and when i do collect my stanley cup yeah then i'll start fucking doing snl and shit like that
i would have feel that my my career would have had,
you know, be fully accomplished.
So I think we can move on from that.
But great, great topic.
Great job by the league.
The league is thriving right now.
Rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum.
A couple more names before we send it to the interview.
Jake Middleton.
I think he'd be hilarious.
He's a funny bastard biz.
Kucherov and Marcus Foligno.
Those are three names that jump out.
Personalities.
Wait, you know who I figured out who Rempe looks like?
It was Rusty Griswold from European Vacation, the second one.
Is that when they're driving around the...
Big Ben Parliament.
Yeah.
He looks just like him.
All right, that fucking fell on his face.
All right, boys.
Let's ask over to Darcy Tucker.
I can't even think of what that actor looked like.
I'm not trying to rain on your single.
We can come out of Darcy Tucker with it.
Yeah.
Enjoy.
Enjoy, Leafs fans.
Go, Leafs, go.

Okay, it's time to bring on our next guest.
This gritty Ford was the sixth
round pick of the Canadians at the 1993
draft. After starting his career in
Montreal, then playing in Tampa, he was traded
here to Toronto, where he spent the bulk of his
career before finishing up in Denver.
He played in over 1,000 regular
season and playoff games combined in his
colorful career.
Thanks so much for joining us on the Spittin' Chicklets podcast.
Darcy Tucker.
How you been, my man?
Awesome, guys.
I appreciate it.
Thanks for having me on.
My kids are really looking forward to this.
I have two boys, so they're jacked about me coming on.
Uh-oh.
Who jacked to have you?
Hey, you left out the craziest part.
Three Memorial Cups in a row?
Oh, yeah.
Not in a row oh yeah uh not in a row uh the first one was
in uh 91 92 and we had uh niedermeyer sudor cory hirsch we had a really good team and then uh we
took a year off retooled and uh brought in a gindlin doan and jeez tyson nash tyson nash
bad boy ryan huska he still has that has that varsity jacket blazer you guys had.
You guys were the fuckers.
I'm sure he's still wearing that around Phoenix.
Hey, he had a decent career, but fuck, those were the glory days, man.
You guys had basically a dynasty in junior, which some say the hardest trophy to win, right?
Because you got to win your league and then go on to play the best of the other leagues.
Yeah, absolutely.
I think that when you look back at that team and that group that they assembled,
I don't think you could do it in today's way of doing things. With the draft, they found both me
and Shane Doan on this Bantam C team in the middle of Alberta and nobody knew who the heck we were
or what was going on. We were lighting up the league together. He was a year younger than me, but we played together.
And it was kind of crazy how a guy by the name of Tim Arnold
took a video of our team.
And it's not like the videos nowadays where you just get to take your phone.
It was one of those big things you set up in the corner of the rink.
And there's like 20 people in the stands.
They're like, what is wrong with this guy setting up this video at Bantam Sea Hockey?
But yeah, both Shane and I were playing that night
and had a good night and they sent it off
to the Camelot Blazers and they put us
on the protected list and we ended up playing together
and winning those cups.
So it says Castor, Alberta, hometown?
No, that's where I was born.
I was born there because it was a snowstorm
and my dad was playing senior men's
and we couldn't get to the hospital where I was supposed to be born.
So I ended up being born in Castor, Alberta.
My hometown's Indiang, Alberta.
It's 25 people now live there.
It used to be a little bit bigger, but the grocery store and the garage and all that stuff's gone from my hometown.
But it's, yeah, it's an interesting place guys.
You, you would actually have the best time out there cause you can do whatever
the heck you want.
There's the nearest neighbor is like a mile and a half away and you can't see
them.
So it's, it's farm life.
Was it, was it Oilers and Flames for you?
A hundred percent Oilers for me. I grew up a Gretzky fan. So being in Games for you? 100 Oilers for me.
I grew up a Gretzky fan, so being in Gretzky's
basement is pretty cool for me.
So we were divided in the house.
My dad and I were Oilers, and my mom and my
brother were Flames.
There was some wars in the house, trust me.
That's awesome.
Going back to those Kamloops days, it was like
training every day with all these great players,
like ironing, sharpening iron.
Like, what was it like?
And I'm sure like, I don't know, today these new players are a little soft.
They got curfew.
Like, you guys must have been going out and finding a lot of trouble in those days.
We had a good time.
I would say this, like, we had a pretty strict coach in Don Hayes.
So, he kept things pretty tight, tight ship there.
Don Hayes. So he kept things pretty tight, tight ship there. Although there was a few sticks broken in practice, Hayes was a pretty intense coach to have in junior hockey, but more kind of like a
dad figure. I tell people this all the time that he was more of a mentor for us young guys. And
that's why I think a lot of us ended up playing pro is because he kind of taught us, hey, listen,
if you do the
right things you do them over and over again you're gonna have success and you look at guys
that have went on to have great careers off that team it's amazing I think we had nine guys drafted
off the one memorial cup team and I think seven of them had really good NHL careers was it something
for you where I mean like it was basically I don't want to play against this guy and and was it something for you where i mean like it was basically i don't want to play against this guy
and and was it like that your whole life you were always just like in people's face or was that
taught to you later on no i i and you try to tell young guys in today's game you're a skilled guy
you're getting all these points in junior then you you know you you go down to the american league
you light it up there but you can't just make it into the NHL.
Just maybe your skating is not good enough. Maybe your size is a detriment to you. I had to change
my game. There was no way in the world I would have played in the national hockey league, just
trying to be one of those guys that was going to be a, you know, 30 goal guy, 90 point guy in the
NHL. And my thing was you better get after it and you better change your game to be effective to help not only your hockey club win, but actually be able to play the game as long as I did.
There was no way in the world if I was not a rat on the ice that I was going to stick around.
I would have been that tweener between the NHL and the American League, score 90 points in the American league and be that call up, up and down, up and down. And it's a lot easier to ride around in the private jet, uh, than make 30 grand
down riding the bus in the American league. So we often talk about what you just said, like,
are you willing to change? And I mean, 140 points, two years in a row in the dub. So it was like,
you had the skill, but you were smart enough to know, like, I'm good, but I'm not that good when
you get to that next level. And that's the thing he i was a good hockey player but i was never going
to translate to the nhl game my game i wasn't fast enough i wasn't very big and you had these
guys coming into the league and that was when the game started kind of started to change you had
guys coming in the league that were six two that could skate like they were 5'10", and they could score.
And I wasn't able to translate that between the American League
and the NHL.
So how do I fit in?
What is my role in the team going to be?
Am I going to be a second-line guy?
Probably not.
So I'm going to be between the third and fourth line.
I'm going to have to be that rat that makes sure that the opposition knows
when I'm on the ice that it's not going to be an easy game.
Was that hard to do that?
Because all of a sudden you're like, all right, now I'm going to be hated. Yeah. It's a lot easier said than done, I'm on the ice that it's not going to be an easy game. Was that hard to do that? Like, like, cause all of a sudden you're like, all right, now I'm going to be hated.
Yeah.
It's a lot easier said than done.
I'm saying it wasn't natural for me.
It wasn't natural for me either, but it's like, I, I, my personality away from the game.
Like that's what people don't know.
I, I look on Twitter and social media, even today that people in Long Island want me dead.
So I, I know that it's not easy.
It's not one of those things
that comes natural to certain people.
And it wasn't for me.
I wanted to be liked everywhere I went.
But at the same time.
I like money.
You're making a living.
You're making a choice between how you want to live
and how you want your family to be set up for life
after you're done the game.
So in order to do that, I had to be that player.
I had to do it.
Was it a coach or GM that got in your ear and just say,
hey, you might want to do this?
Or was it just on your own, you realized I got to make this adjustment?
I think kind of a little bit.
My first year in Montreal, I played three games up from Fredericton that year.
And I think I played four shifts in the three games.
And I'm thinking, there's no way I'm going to be able to play in this league
unless I do something different.
So I went home that summer, had many great conversations with my father,
who's a great mentor to me.
And he had always good advice.
He's like, you're just basically going to have to fight your way into the league.
You're going to have to do it.
So I played all seven exhibition games the next year with Mario Trombley as a coach.
And I fought every game.
That was my mentality going into camp.
Yeah.
Like, it's like, do you want to be here?
And how do you stand out from the other guys that, you know, because there was other guys vying for that spot that were probably more skilled in me and their game would translate coming from the American League than mine.
So how do i fit in you know i knew the fourth line was going to be turner stevenson and
scott thornton and whoever what can i do to help that line and help us be successful as a team
and stick around and i caused all the problems and they fixed them is there any chance i know
it was just three games that one year but that was the year of uh the the 10 nothing red wings drubbing when wa went by the bench were you up for that game so i i was there
uh the week before and then got sent back down and i didn't play a game uh they called me up on
kind of that emergency whatever it was and i could see there was some some tension going on
oh it was already it was already bubbling mario. Mario and Patrick had some tension between them.
So when it happened, I actually wasn't surprised
one bit.
Okay.
So I ended up coming back and playing my games
after Paddy had left.
But yeah, you could see there was something in
the air about what was going to happen there.
And it ended up working out for Patrick.
He went and won another Stanley Cup.
So pretty cool.
I want to ask, when you would have the style,
was it to drag your team into the fight?
Like I say, it was an off night.
Were you just going to do it no matter what,
whether the guys were into the game?
Was it just like the new mentality,
no matter what the situation in the game was?
Well, people always thought I was just this crazy guy
out there doing crazy stuff.
And yeah, to a point.
A little bit.
To a point. But there was always a little bit yeah, to a point. A little bit. There's some weird shit.
To a point,
but there was always a little bit of method
to the madness.
So if we're down by two goals,
the only way to drag us
back into the fight
was to go after Char
the rest of the night.
Like the little guy
going out there
trying to hit the biggest guy
on the ice.
Hey guys,
maybe we better get
our asses going here
and get back in this game.
And then if we're up to nothing, I'm going after Savard,
Marc Savard.
The rest of the game, I'm driving him nuts
because the only way they're getting back in that game
is if he starts to light it up and turn it back on.
So if I'm driving him nuts and he can't score
and he can't dictate the way the game's going to go,
that's going to help us win the game.
There was some method to it, but there was always
times where the wires touched and they went off and I did something that I probably shouldn't have done it.
Pat Quinn would look at me and be like, yeah, this probably wasn't the best thing you should have done.
So did you go in and ask for the matchup?
Like, did you like being that guy to defend the other team's top players?
No, I, I, I wasn't really, I kind of played that, that kind of in-between role even then.
Like I wasn't good enough to play against
the other team's best players and shut them down that was more shane corson's job he was a better
skater bigger stronger so you know when you were playing against ottawa and yashin and albertson
were on the ice usually corson's line would would go out and do that um i was more of the guy that
stirred the pot with chris neal and tried to get him to go to the penalty box and then run away.
And hopefully Ty looked after the rest of it.
Cause I wasn't, everybody says, hey, Tuck,
you fought a lot.
Yeah.
I fought a lot.
I fought out of necessity.
I didn't fight because I was tough because I
definitely wasn't the tough.
You were willing.
Yeah.
I was willing and able and I didn't care if I
got my nose punched in for sure.
But you just did what you had to do.
You mentioned the Sends and Chris.
Now we've got to talk about that incident.
You basically just dove into the bench from the ice
and just started scrapping.
Take us through what was going through your mind at that.
Was it a wise-crossing incident,
or were you having a little fun there?
I think a little bit of both.
They had absolutely abused us that year
during the regular season.
I think it was game seven out of eight times
that we played them that year. We were in ottawa and we were absolutely getting spanked and uh travis green
uh ran somebody one of their players behind the net and got a penalty and was mad and neil was
giving it to him for doing it and they were pointing at each other and travis is a really
good friend of mine and uh i just saw him pointing and i'm like pointing to chris neal okay
i got it and i just jumped in there and the wire uh i still have bumps on the top of my head and
numb spots from where the trainer smacked me that's how much i was this oh yeah oh yeah
hilarious you have no idea like i'm like i got suspended for five games how did the trainer not
get anything out of that like you can't suspend the trainer.
He smacked me right on top of the head as hard as he could.
If you look at the video,
you can see it in the video.
Oh yeah.
You can see,
he just jumps over and just whops me on top of the head.
And I'm like,
that's where that,
but it was,
uh,
I think it was a time where we needed to send a message and say,
Hey,
listen,
we got to get back in this fight.
Cause they were,
they were abusing us.
And then we ended up
playing them in the playoffs
and won that series.
I think sometimes
a little bit of like
nastiness
rallies the guys
on your bench
and kind of puts them on notice
that, hey,
we're not going to back down
from this.
Yeah.
Was it hard as a young player
to balance life
playing in Montreal?
Like,
especially in that era
where it's just like,
fuck guys,
I'm drinking.
You're just a rock star.
It was.
You're a rock star.
Cash and check.
It was really,
you're a Yankee.
Yeah.
It was really tough because I lived with Terry
Ryan my first year.
Jesus Christ.
It was a 19 and 20 year old,
uh,
in a three bedroom,
uh,
condo overlooking the city.
So there was times where the,
we had to,
I had to bring him down to earth
because he thought, I'm in the National Hockey League.
And I'll never leave, he thought.
Well, he thought he was going to be the mayor of Montreal
right from the start.
And I'm like, TR, don't put the cart before the horse here.
We still have some work to do.
No, I'm going to fight Tidomi.
Right away, he fought Taitomi.
He got knocked out.
By Christmas, he was back in the Western Hockey League
and I was sitting there by myself in a three-bedroom condo
that was costing us 2,500 a month.
I'm like, this is like half my paycheck.
What is going on here?
You must have at least one wild T. Astroian Shia
that's family-friendly somewhat.
How much time you got? I could sit here all day and talk about T. Astroy and Shia that's family friendly somewhat. How much time you got?
Like I could sit here all day and talk about TR and his craziness.
Probably my best story was after I retired and I went to,
I went to the basement.
I was there on a trip to,
for Easter seals and we were doing an event there playing hockey games,
whatever.
And TR invited me over to the basement.
I don't think I remember my own name when I left that basement.
I'm like, because senior started telling stories
and I love hockey stories.
I could sit and listen to old time hockey stories
for hours and hours.
And he started telling stories and one beer would come
and another beer would come.
And I'm like, I think mom had to walk me up the stairs to get me out of that joint because it is so much fun down that basement.
And there's so much memorabilia that they both have.
And so many stories that go along with it.
It also, it also goes away from hockey too, because of their knowledge for music.
Yeah.
Which like, so just hearing them talk and how passionately they talk about it it just draws you in like both
of them are are some of the best storytellers i've ever i've ever seen yours the best storyteller of
all time i could listen to him tell the same story a million times i was with him last night i got a
good 30 minutes and i loved and i don't say a word yeah i i've heard he's only allowed to have
pints on fridays now so you got to catch him on a friday so i saw him last night it was thursday
we had our show and he's crushing up a beer.
I said, holy shit, what's going on?
It's Thursday.
He said, sometimes I make exceptions.
And then later he said he had to ask the wife,
like TR and senior were both like, come on, mom, it's okay.
So I actually feel honored now because it always
used to be just Terry.
He would go up to and say, hey, I need a beer
where Terry's kind of like, buddy, go find a
beer somewhere.
Like, I'm not your fucking beer fetcher.
And for the first time yesterday, he came out
to me, he goes, hey, I need a beer.
I need a beer.
And you fetched one?
Without even saying hi first.
And I'm like, you know what?
As pissed I am you didn't say hello first.
I'll get you a beer.
I feel honoured.
I feel honoured that you asked me like your son.
Absolutely.
He's such an amazing man.
Great family.
And I remember the first time his mom called the condo and I answered the phone and the
lady in the other end is, hi, it's Meme.
Is Terry there?
And I'm like, hey, Terry, there's somebody on the phone named Meme.
He goes, that's my mom, you idiot.
I'm like, oh, I didn't understand the language.
Was it hard? Like the move from Montreal?
Did you expect it?
Like, how did that go down?
Every first trade's kind of a little shocking,
taking them back.
Yeah, that's actually a great story
because I wanted out of Montreal.
I wasn't.
Really?
Yeah, so I played under Mario Trombley,
got along with him very well,
had a really good first season in the national hockey again.
Then Elaine Vigneault came in and took over.
He was young then, right?
He didn't much like me and I didn't much like him,
which, hey, that happens in hockey.
You get coaches where you don't get along with them
and you don't see eye to eye.
So I tried to get my way out of there.
I told my agent, I said, call Reggie Houle every day
until I get the hell out of here.
So he did.
But how it ended up going,
we went up to Tron Blanc for the All-Star break.
And back then, you had those old cell phones
where you had to pull up to the,
mine was dead by the time we got up there.
So me and Shannon went to have dinner.
I can't remember what little spot around the corner
before we were going to meet the guys.
And she's watching the TV behind me.
She's like, you just got traded.
No shit.
I'm like, what?
I turned around.
It was on TSN or Sporza or whatever station it was back then.
And yeah, I'd been traded.
So I went out to the payphone and called my agent.
I go, thanks for the heads up.
He's like, I've been calling you for four hours.
And so I didn't have my phone, but he said, yeah, I've been calling you for four hours exactly and uh so i didn't have
my phone but he said yeah i've been calling you and then went up and had a few beers with the guys
and said goodbye and left and went straight to tampa the way that uh information changed and
now is compared to then it's just wild it's nuts but what's wild compared to then and now is tampa
the lightning then it was it was i mean now you've seen what they've built and obviously with the success, but the fan base.
But then it was a lot different.
It was point night when you played the Lightning back then, right?
We stunk.
You have no idea.
When I got down there, because Jacques Demers was the coach in Montreal
when I first got drafted and had a good relationship.
And then when I got down there, he was the coach.
And he's like, I'm going to turn you into my little Doug Gilmore.
You're going to play against the other team's best players every night. was the coach and he's like i'm gonna turn you into my little doug gilmore you're gonna play
against the other team's best players every night i'm like so i'm gonna play against eric lindros
and the legion of doom every night and try to check eric i i'm like you can't be serious right
now and it was 10 to every time we played them and i was minus six i'm like we might have to
rethink what we're doing here there's no way in I'm going to chase that big son of a gun around the ice and try to check him and think that it's going to be something that works for us.
So, yeah, it was point night.
Every time somebody played us, we were just so bad.
He's like, don't worry, Tuck.
Pittsburgh's coming in tomorrow.
You got Mario and Yachts.
That's exactly what it was.
And I'm thinking to myself, I grew up watching these guys.
And I'm like, I've got to check them now and i'm not the best skater and i'm not going to be able to check
anything and that was back when you could like clutch and grab and i was literally hanging off
eric's ankles and trying to take him down get off me kid like what it must it must have meant a lot
and probably mattered in the future that he did put that trust in you right yeah it gave me
confidence because i went out of montreal i'd lost every bit of confidence that i'd had as a and probably mattered in the future that he did put that trust in you, right? Yeah, it gave me confidence.
Because coming out of Montreal, I'd lost every bit of confidence
that I'd had as a hockey player.
I'm like, there's no way I'm going to be able to play in this league.
It's just too much for me.
And he restored that confidence to get me kind of back to the mentality
where, hey, if I play the game the right way,
I'm going to get an opportunity.
It doesn't matter if it's here or if it's somewhere else.
What was that? Sorry, but let's go ahead. Well, no, I just want to get an opportunity. It doesn't matter if it's here or if it's somewhere else. What was that?
Sorry, but let's go ahead.
Well, no, I just want to know, like you said it kind of like not ended ugly, but you wanted out by the end of Montreal, but still the original six and then playing there with the history.
Like you have, like what's your fondest memory of being a Montreal Canadian?
My fondest memory is meeting my wife there.
Shane Corson got traded to our team
back from St. Louis.
Ended up meeting my future wife
through Shane, his sister.
And that's my fondest memory of Montreal.
We have a great family.
I've got three unbelievable children.
And that would be probably my biggest memory
coming out of Montreal.
How did you break the news to him that you were dating his sister?
I said, you just made the biggest mistake of your life.
It reduces your sister because I will chase her until.
First thing you said back to him after meeting her.
I'm like, he asked me to go to brunch with him.
It was at the Royal York here in Toronto.
It was my first trip like here with him as my roommate.
He's like, let's meet downstairs with my mom and sister.
I'm thinking,
yeah,
it's fine.
No problem.
They come down,
I'm hung over.
I got my tie around my neck,
whatever.
I'm going to go for brunch with Coors.
The minute I laid eyes on her,
it was,
I'm like,
I turned around and said,
you just made the biggest mistake,
dude.
I'm going to chase her until this is over with.
Did part of the fact that he would be your brother-in-law kind of play into it too,
or this guy's a beauty and like, I kind of get to marry into this family?
Well, I never had an older brother, and Sheen was like that for me right from the get-go.
We hit it off right away.
He was a great roommate.
He taught me a lot about, especially being in Montreal, it's not an easy place to play.
And he knew everybody in the city, so he made it very easy on me
i was gonna go back to toronto you must have been fired up when you got traded to toronto
after tampa bay they've been struggling but uh what was like playing for pat quinn just one of
the legendary names of history in hl especially as a coach too what was that like yeah pat was
amazing i wouldn't be the same husband father uh person that i am today without pat quinn pat
quinn taught me so much and you can talk about the hockey element of it.
He let us be who we were as personalities.
He didn't take any personality out of any of the players that ever played for him.
But just the human element and what it was like to be a person in the game.
He had so many great stories about his time playing.
And it kind of translated to me as a person.
Like, you know, I did some pretty filthy things on the ice.
Pat almost killed Bobby Orr once.
He went through kind of those aspects of it and to actually be able to bounce some of those things off him and, and have that relationship was pretty cool.
Um, you know, I was there when, uh, Pat was inducted in the hall of fame, uh, with his family and his daughters there.
It, it's, it was a pretty special moment
and just a great human being.
Like, Pat was always there for his players.
He never threw us under the bus.
He never blamed us for anything.
He was always a type of coach that had the players' backs,
and I think we really appreciated that.
I played for him in Edmonton.
He was older.
He was, like, larger than life, though.
Yeah.
Like, how he dressed, his presence.
It was like.
He looked like, yeah, he's like a cartoon.
It's almost such strong features.
Yeah.
He could have walked in a room and you're like, that's somebody.
Even if he didn't know hockey.
Absolutely.
He's that type of guy.
And you know, it's like anything in life.
You know, the game goes so fast and sometimes as you get older,
maybe it passes you by a little bit. And I know, you know know pat is that guy he he loved the game of hockey so much it's just
sometimes hard at the end of your coaching career or even your hockey career to kind of keep up with
the way the young guys coming in that's what i mean it's and you hear some things like you know
pat wasn't this or pat wasn't that you got got, you got to say to yourself, like when you're a hockey player,
take maybe some of the X and O's out of it and just listen to what he's
actually trying to tell you as a,
as a human.
And that'll translate to your game on the ice as well.
Yeah.
It's crazy to me.
Like those Toronto teams,
you guys had some good teams and it's success and like hard teams to play
against.
Like it's crazy.
What's kind of happened.
And obviously last year they got over the hump,
but you probably never could have imagined
that the run it would be
before they got out of the first round again
when you were there.
Yeah, well, when our team kind of dismantled there,
when Mats, myself, Brian McCabe,
Kubina and Caverly kind of all left the team,
I think that was kind of like the dark hole moment
where the team kind of went in a different direction.
And it took them almost seven years to get out of it.
And then you draft Austin and then you draft Mitch and then you got Willie.
And it's a great hockey team.
I wish you could put those two teams together that, you know.
Oh my God.
2000 to 04 team and a combination of that grit that we had then and, and, and what they have now with the skill,
because we were a little underskilled,
but we would beat you in the street.
That's how we,
that was the mentality that we took as a team.
We weren't already skilled,
but we were going to,
we're going to come at you.
We were going to pound you.
We're going to make you pay the price.
And if it all worked out at the end,
God bless.
But we were so beat up by the end of it that we couldn't get past that next
part of it to get to the Stanley Cup finals.
And then you look at this team now,
they're unbelievably, I loved it the way they skate,
the way they move the puck and all those things,
but there's just an element of that, just that.
That motherfucker.
Yeah, like I'm going to come at you until, you know,
you give up type of attitude.
You'd love to see just a little bit more of that.
I think too, and I'm sure you'd agree,
but I think that's what makes Leafs fans
maybe love you even more.
It's because they miss it, right?
They're like, oh, that's what we had.
And so it's like guys like you and Corson and those dudes.
I agree.
And the Wendell Clarks.
I see those guys a ton down at the rink.
And I just look at them and how,
you know,
how much they put through for this organization,
how hard they played for this organization and how much they care about this
organization.
It's a pretty special place to play if you're a hockey player.
You mentioned McCabe and I've gotten to know him a little bit.
Unreal guy.
Pan opener.
Oh,
what was the thought in the locker room after Chara had him?
One of the most insane clips of all time. What a set of balls on him, opener oh what what what was the thought in the locker room after chara had him the bet the one
of the most insane clips of all three what a set of balls on him to even fight the guy i love brian
we roomed together for six years we roomed together even after we could have our own rooms that's how
that's how great a relationship uh we had together as uh guys that played together and then roomed
together but uh we were screaming from the bench,
like, do, absolutely do not do that.
And he did it.
And I don't know if I've ever seen a 220 pound man
get helicoptered by another man like that in my life.
He was in the ringer and he could not,
he was in the spin cycle and there was no getting out of it.
And I'm like, please, please God, hit him just in the chiclet so there was no getting out of it and i'm like please please
god hit him just in the chiclet so he gets new teeth because his teeth were terrible i said don't
hit him in the head because we need him just knock out all his teeth um you guys had a lot of
personalities in that locker room too right like how were you guys able to kind of manage that
especially playing in a place like toronto where like there's so much outside noise,
like, but yeah, you guys did have success.
Yeah.
I think Pat was a big part of that.
Uh, he held that group together.
I'm not going to say that there wasn't, you know, friction in that locker room, but sometimes
when you're driving a Ferrari, you know, friction in the engine to make it go a little faster.
Right.
So we had that and, and guys put peer pressure on each other to play the game the way
we thought it needed to be played and if you didn't pull up your socks and you weren't back
checking you were guys like gary roberts and shane corison and tight they tell you you were
getting called out in the room guys were getting called out you were set hey pick up your socks
you know put it in gear here like you're not pulling your weight and we listened to each
other like even though maybe you didn't like it at the time maybe it was something maybe a little bit of a shot to
your ego at the same time guys went out there the next shift or the next period or the next time
they were on the ice and in a game they were bringing it give me a couple examples of maybe
when you were picking up your slacker you had a bad couple games like ty would say like wake the
fuck up yeah wake up talks the fuck you doing out there
i would say things like that but i i'll never forget when playing with shane and we're we were
close we were brother-in-law right and he would fly past me on the back check and he'd be screaming
at me you're so goddamn slow wake the hell up get your ass in gear like play harder and i'm like
that's my brother he's being mean to me i better get going here like
if you got somebody that close to you screaming at you to wake the hell up and play harder
that was a big wake-up call for me because he had my ear he was the biggest influence in my career
he had my ear so if he was saying that to me i better get my ass going where would you rank ty
as far as like all-time heavyweights like he he was just a fucking pit bull. I would say this.
Ty Domi did his job like no other player
I've ever seen before.
He could do things in the game to change the game.
He flew, right?
He flew fast.
He won the fastest skater in our team a couple of times
at the-
Yeah, like the Leafs skill competition.
I'm like, I think he might've cheated a couple of times.
But he was fast and he played the game physical and he was there for his teammates and he fought every heavy.
Every, he was not afraid to make sure that if somebody touched mats or somebody came near or something on the ice happened, Ty was right there.
And that's a, that's a huge compliment to do that job for as long as Ty did against every heavy in the league.
Yeah, he didn't back down from the little buddy.
Were you there that night in Philly when he got in with the penalty blocks?
Somebody smashed me from behind.
I think I might have been laying on the ice, picking up.
That was like a yard sale.
My gloves, helmet were everywhere.
I might not have been hurt that bad, but Ty took it into his own hands
to make sure that everybody knew, don't touch the young guy in the team.
And then that guy went to penalty box and Ty fed him.
Talk about the wrong guy in the box.
You went in the wrong area at the wrong time.
Ty was giving it to him.
It was, from our perspective, you know,
I was getting cut off the ice.
I was giggling to myself because you just do not fall
in the penalty box.
Did guys go flying over there?
I don't remember.
I don't think anybody went over there.
Ty had it all under control.
Yeah, he did need to.
I think there was a ref that ended up in the penalty box.
I think he held his hands back while Ty was beating the guy.
But we had no problem.
If Ty was getting in a fight, everybody backed off.
Nobody had to protect Ty.
And I never, the funny thing is I never saw Ty Domi bleed in his whole career,
except for game six against Ottawa.
He got shoved a little bit into the boards and hit the dasher.
He got us a five-minute major.
And we were down two at the time.
We ended up coming back and winning game six in Ottawa and won game seven at
O.
Oh.
To put him out in 2002.
And that was the only time I ever saw Ty Domi bleeding, ever.
What a perfect time to bleed though.
It's almost like he saved. Biblical.oby bleeding. Ever. What a perfect time to bleed, though. It's almost like he saved it.
Biblical.
Exactly.
You mentioned that Long Islander, about the New York Islanders.
Obviously, you had Michael Pecker, the 0-2 playoffs.
He comes back.
He ends up signing with Toronto a few years later.
Did you guys have a clearing of the year?
Were there any meetings before just to make sure everything would be kosher?
It's a good story, actually.
So when I knew Michael was going to come to Toronto,
uh, knew a couple of his friends and a couple of his relatives and they put together, uh,
a little, uh, dinner, lunch, uh, slash golf game for us. So we went and had lunch together,
cleared the air, played a little bit of golf. I think I dug in his pocket that day too.
That was pretty cool. Uh, but yeah, we, we became really good friends after that. Our boys went to school together, came good buddies, went out for dinner, lots on the road.
I got a lot of respect for Michael, the way he played the game.
We were very similar in the aspect of, it was kind of the eye for the eye, you know, sort of a deal.
You do your thing on the ice.
I'm going to do mine right back to you.
So you got to have a little bit of respect for that.
I remember in, in that series, it kind of
culminated in game one.
He hit me with an elbow, the reverse elbow, and
I was in La La Land.
I didn't even know my own name.
I was chewing on my tongue.
Travis Green was like, the UK, man, like get it
together here.
We got to win this series.
So I, I didn't forget it.
Then there was a chance in game five and, you
know, I, I finished my check in a, in a legal form at the time. No penalty called. Yeah my check in a legal form at the time.
No penalty called. No penalty.
Legal form at the time. So that was the one where
you went low and took out his knee.
But...
Here we go.
Okay.
You might see something.
Leaf on leaf lover.
Lower compared than normal.
And that was where the argument lied.
I have no-
And I think they changed the rule after that for hip checking.
You couldn't go a certain distance down to make a hip check.
But it was my hip that hit him.
And that's why you said Islanders fans still want you dead.
Oh, they want me dead for not reason.
I remember that.
You won't be doing any alumni games against the Islanders.
No, and I was kind of giggling last night when the boys picked Barzell to put him on the leaf squad i was like this is great yeah yeah i actually
remember uh that was like i was probably 18 and the nassau coliseum because my buddy sean bait
scored the yeah sort of shootout goal that was crazy he scored the uh goal i think it was a
minute and 40 seconds left in the game or something and caber got called and he got a penalty shot and scored on cujo and it was nuts in there crazy absolute on that's one of
the places that i didn't mind when they blew it up and tore it down that it went right to the ground
because i could not stand that place they hated me there and i hated playing there i know i didn't
like that barn either um i feel like a lost guy in the shuffle is more guilty and you got to play with him most talented guy i ever played with hands down not even really not even heard that a
lot not even close that guy could score three a night in his sleep if alex had just a little more
of a care yeah a little just like he'd sit on the bench sometimes beside me like i don't feel it
today you have to do all the work i'm like oh, oh, this is going to be a long one.
There's going to be no back checky at all,
Javi, tonight.
And Paddy would go, hey, we got to get course
of that lens because Elmo doesn't feel it today.
Of course, get up, do all the back checking.
But he'd take a stick, score three goals with it,
and be like, this thing was garbage tonight.
Go cut one down the next night.
Get two with it.
He's like, that's the best. But you got three with the other one. He goes, I don't know. That was garbage tonight. Go cut one down the next night. Get two with it. He's like, that's the best.
I mean, you got three with the other one.
He goes, I don't know.
That was garbage too.
Like didn't care.
Changes skates in between periods.
Not from just CCM skates to CCM skates, but CCM to Bauer to Graf.
And I'm like, what is wrong with you?
He just couldn't sit still enough to stay in the moment.
But when he was in the moment, watch the heck out.
Gamer.
Gamer.
He was, but it was just so much, he's the natural.
Didn't really even matter.
And he lived on his talent.
Was he, was he a Russian in a sense of kind of on his own away from the rink?
I would say, yeah, he was more of an honest, on his own guy, but he loved his wine.
He loved going out for dinners with the boys.
He, you know, he was a guy's guy like he would go out for dinner and drink his wine and sit at the
end of the table and swirl it and tell us how great it was because we couldn't afford it
sorry boys that's russian that is russian 100 remember when we saw um malcolm again
oh my god oh vodka man vodka man vodka man vodka man he's
just chirping me yeah um so matt sundin's a guy that like everyone you know you should remember
how dominant he was but even i don't think he does many interviews he seemed like a quiet leader but
how much did you learn from him what was he like in the room he was a great leader he he answered
all the questions there was never a time that matt didn't come out of the back to answer all the questions for the toronto media and that's
you got to get off that that is tough that's a lot of respect because there's nights where
things wouldn't go according to plan and mats would come out and answer all the tough questions
you know especially in the playoffs when you lose like to have your leader uh front and center and
answering all those questions uh he was great that way.
And he led by example.
He wasn't the type of guy that would stand up in the room and go rah, rah, do this, do that.
He was just, he was a quiet leader that would, he would drag you into the fight because he was always the type of guy that would play hard at the big time.
He played, he played his rear end opposite.
And to say something about him, he got hurt in the playoffs a couple of times and came back from injuries
and there's no way he should have even been on the ice.
Like there were broken bones or torn ligaments
and he was back out there fighting with the boys
and trying to win that Stanley Cup.
Was he doing a lot of talking at intermissions
or more just-
Yeah, he was quiet.
Max didn't speak that way.
He was more of like,
hey, jump on my back, follow me on the ice.
We had the vocal. We had enough guys in that room to talk. That's why I said hey, jump on my back, follow me on the ice. We had the vocal.
We had enough guys in that room to talk.
That's right.
That's why I said, first, now he's on my fucks,
and he must have had his hands full.
Yeah, he didn't have to say much when it came to whether we were playing
the right way or playing a crappy game.
There was enough guys in that locker room to put enough heat on each other
to do things the right way.
Well, now, Paul Maurice came in after Pat Quinn.
Did your role change at all?
Or did he just keep doing the same thing out there?
Oh, right.
One of the best Paul Maurice stories is when Paul
got named coach and he calls us in.
We had one of the best power players in the league
at the time with Caverly, McCabe, Sundin, and there
was Wellwood on there, it was Jason Allen.
There was other guys that went in that other spot,
but I think we were number two in the league the year before in the
power play.
Maurice comes in, he goes, McCabe, you're
going to, you're going to take the puck
from him behind the net.
They took it away from Caberle.
And I'm like, this is the biggest mistake.
So the first four games of the year, we're
0-4 on the power play.
He calls us back and he goes, what was
that thing where Caberle takes the puck
again?
We're like, just give it to Caverly.
He'll get it down to the other end and we'll
do our thing.
And we went from being last in the league back
up to the top.
He had that short stick too to the knee and he
would basically be standing straight up and he
could just.
Caverly's?
Yeah.
It was crazy.
You just scan the ice.
He was so, he's one of the best defensemen not
to get as much credit.
He was awesome.
As he should have.
And maybe he got, he got a little overshadowed
by a lot of the personalities on our team
because we had a big personality.
I also feel like that maybe the ending in
Boston created that mindset from like a.
I think maybe it could have like, but when
he was here, he was the backbone of our team.
We couldn't have got to some of the places
that we were able to get to as a team without
Thomas, he was so skilled. And think the one hit that uh when jansen hit him well i think that was
the one that kind of set him back in his career because he was on a trajectory to be that hall
of fame sort of guy yeah like a norris trophy type guy i agree who got him camdanson oh he got him
good clean uh it was clean but it was 14 and a half seconds late.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The body check was legal.
It was the timing of the body check.
Yeah.
Cappy was, Cappy was looking somewhere else.
I think somebody was on a breakaway.
Did anybody go after Jansen?
Well, I was hurt.
I had broken my foot and I was just about to
come back.
So I, I went along the bench there to make
sure that Cam knew it was coming and then him and Belak fought the next game in Toronto.
Everybody was ready for that one. Who was the guy that you were legit in a sword fight and
warmups with? Oh, Avery. Yeah, you and Avery. Have you seen him at him off the ice?
I have not run into him in post-retirement.
I'd seen him a few times before that.
Needless to say, we both had kind of the same personality.
Yeah.
He might have taken it a little further than me
from time to time with his words.
But on the ice, we had very similar personalities.
We played the game the same way.
He was a, you know, disturber of the piece
and I was just getting a little older
and didn't want to disturb the piece and i was just getting a little older and
didn't want to disturb the pieces yeah you're like this is really adding up there was there
at the end of my career i remember going there's like young guys like dorset and oh god rich clue
and guys coming into the league and they wanted a piece and i'm like yeah i'm ready i'm actually
don't i actually like you i'm not a bad guy. Yeah, I don't. Here's my number.
I'll scrub some pops in the summer.
That's exactly how it was.
I'll never forget the older guys on the team.
Like you kind of lost your edge, eh?
And I'm like, yeah.
Like you try doing that every night for the last 12.
I got kids.
Yeah.
My kids are looking at me like, why are you so angry, dad?
Like I'm actually not, but I got to play that role.
What did you do during the lockout?
The 0-4, 0-5 lockout. You didn't go got to play that role. What did you do during the lockout, the 0405 lockout?
You didn't go overseas to play, right?
No.
Listen, I think that obviously there was some guys playing over there that,
and I remember having buddies over there that were playing in England
and places like that.
They were just surviving and hanging on to their careers,
and I just thought it was something that I didn't want to do.
Right.
Yeah.
I'd rather stay in shape here and, and hang out with, uh, we had a group of guys that
skated out of, uh, uh, York university during the lockout that year.
And it was one of the best skates that, uh, I'd ever been a part of.
We had, uh, guys that had played senior hockey here that were from different teams and they
come to our skate every day.
And there was myself, Shane Corson, Igor Olenov was there.
Downey was there.
We had a good group.
We had a lot of fun together.
So you basically didn't want to be responsible for some guy who needed the job.
That's the way I felt about it.
And I didn't, hey, listen, guys that went over there and did it, God bless you.
You want to stay in shape and do it that way?
Perfect.
It just wasn't my kind of scene.
Were you a part of the CBA stuff as the cap came in?
Were you involved with the Players Association?
Well, Caber was our guy that looked after all that,
and I was supposed to be the second in command,
and I'm like, this is way too much lawyer stuff
for me to keep in track.
I said, just call me when it's over and let me know
when I can go back and play hockey.
And at the end of your Toronto tenure,
did they offer you a deal at the end
when you ended up signing with Colorado?
No, so what happened was I got bought out by the Leafs.
I'd signed that four-year deal.
I had had a great year in my contract year.
I had 20 goals at Christmas that year.
It was probably going to be the best year of my career.
And Cabriolet, who never shoots the puck,
shot it from the point one night,
and I wasn't looking.
It broke my foot.
Dude, at 20 at Christmas?
At 20 at Christmas.
I was lighting it up.
I think 18 were on the par.
But let's take it easy now.
But he broke my foot.
And I missed nine weeks.
And I think I got four the rest of the year.
So it kind of  but I had signed my contract while I was hurt.
I signed that four-year deal for 3 million a year to stay here in Toronto.
And I had the no movement clause.
And then when things kind of fell apart here in Toronto and they wanted to change the dynamic of the team, they bought me out.
And that's when I went to Colorado.
And it kind of ripped a piece of me.
I was going to ask.
I'm a Toronto guy.
I like the bright lights.
I like the, you know, it's just my personality.
I don't mind it, you know.
And it takes a special person to not mind being the hated guy and the villain
and,
and not part of it.
And it didn't bother me because I had such a good home life that,
uh,
it ripped a piece of me when I went to,
went to Colorado and I was never the same player.
It was never going to be something where I could continue.
My kids tell me all the time,
you're 40 some odd games away from a thousand that I,
we could have had, uh, those silver sticks in our rooms and i'm like guys i wasn't picking my family up
and moving anymore it was just that was it yeah also too like could you have could you have played
oh i could if i'd have wanted to get back in shape and be that guy again i could have played
i had offers to go play but you know you're gonna go play for league minimum you know it's gonna
cost you two hundred thousand dollars to move the goddamn family.
And fight.
And then I'm going to have to be back in the battle again.
And it's going to be one of those things where I was just, I wasn't that guy anymore.
I remember, I'd remembered going to the airport.
There was times where I'm like, I didn't even want to go on the road trip.
I'd rather watch my boys play hockey and my daughter go to her dance recital.
It just gets to that point where you feel like something else is more important to you.
What about in terms of post-retirement and you
make it sound like you were ready to be done,
but that first year is tough.
We talk a lot about guys going through it.
Was it hard that first year?
No.
That's good.
It wasn't.
You were ready.
I was ready because I was ready to be with my
kids.
My kids were at that age where they were old enough
where they were starting sports and i wanted to be a part of that and i wanted to help them through
that um so i was i was absolutely ready and i never had i had one moment where i thought maybe
i should you know get back into it and try to do it i started skating with barb underhill and
thinking you know maybe i can come back and do it and i watched her skate and i said there's no way i'll ever skate like that so there's no
use to me coming back to try to do it uh one thing that did happen when you were in colorado
an icing call you end up getting a suspension on i i said that might be the first time i've seen
that and that was an act trust me that was an absolute accident okay my stick got in and i
felt absolutely sick about it uh i think it was green matt green i accident okay my stick got in and i felt absolutely sick about it uh
i think it was green matt green i believe yeah my stick got caught in his skates only because i was
so goddamn slow at that particular point i couldn't catch him and my stick got caught in his skates and
yeah and that's where you start feeling bad when i was young i'd have been like yeah
screw it yeah it doesn't matter but you get to the kind of point in your life where you're like, oh God, I feel so bad.
Like I hurt the guy and yeah, I got suspended.
I think, yeah, I think one game or two.
I think it was one, yeah.
It probably felt bad for me.
I only suspended me one game.
What's awesome though is like, and with your career
in the Leafs and being so recognizable, like when
you're done, you got Scotiabank, you do stuff with Molson.
So it's pretty cool in terms of being in Toronto.
It does set you up for post-career a little bit.
And it absolutely does.
And I watched, you know, Wendell and Daryl before me
and then Doug and them kind of goes through the process
of, you know, what it's like to be a Toronto Maple Leaf.
And then when I moved back here,
I didn't really expect that to, you know,
start happening for me.
I was more moving back because my family's here,
my wife's family's here, and the kids kind of
wanted to be in the hockey mecca of the world
when it comes to minor hockey.
So I didn't expect that part of it.
It kind of grew organically, to be honest.
Really?
Yeah, it was just, I met some really good people
at Scotiabank.
I met some really good people, obviously,
with the Leafs and at Molson
and different people that we became very good friends right off the get-go.
It's almost like your second team.
I say everybody that I work with or work alongside,
it becomes your second team because you actually need something
when you leave the game to strive for or want to be around
a different group of people that you call your team.
And as much as you have your family,
your wife doesn't want you at home every day.
No, no, no, no.
She's like, get out of here.
Either get to the golf course or get somewhere.
They say that's why a lot of the divorces happen
because you go to stop playing and all of a sudden
you're around each other all the time where it's like.
Yeah.
And nobody wants a guy lingering around the house,
vacuuming and driving.
You did that yesterday.
Exactly.
You're a roll ball with your ass cheeks hanging out in the back,
baking cookies.
Yeah, exactly.
I'm going to start cooking now, honey.
Hey, honey, I made you a pie.
Nobody wants that.
Kujo.
Yep.
What an interesting guy.
One of the nicest guys probably to ever play. Oh my God. Kujo. Yep. What an interesting guy. One of the nice, one of the nicest guys probably to ever play.
Oh my God.
Cujo is amazing.
You know, we had two guys here in Toronto in Belfort and Cujo that both should be in the Hall of Fame.
I believe Cujo should be in the Hall of Fame.
They were just a backbone of our team.
We couldn't have been the team that we were without.
They would stop 50 a night and we just, we just open it up and do whatever the
hell we wanted on the other side of it.
And I, I remember there was nights in Toronto
here with both of them and especially Cooge at
the start when I first got here, I'm like, he
stops everything.
Like, especially when the game is on the line,
he just stops everything.
And you feel like you can get away with cheating
on the other side of the puck when you know you
have somebody back there like that.
And just an amazing guy. Like the conversations that we'd have, I'd bounce stuff
off him like, okay, like sticks and that sort of thing, stick position. When I'm coming down,
what are you reading? Because it gives you a little bit of an advantage if you talk to the
goaltender about what he's seeing as opposed to what necessarily you're seeing as a shooter.
Or what you think you're seeing.
I didn't think I saw anything. They closed my eyes and let her hit. You dump it in, you just seeing as a shooter. Or what you think you're seeing. Yeah. I didn't think I saw anything. Yeah. They closed my eyes and let her in.
You dump it in,
you just go run a guy.
Yeah,
exactly.
That's,
Cujo would love that
because he would get back there
and he used to turn his stick over
when he did,
he didn't shoot the puck like normal goal.
Oh,
he had to flip flop it.
He flipped his stick
and he'd do that backhand.
So he'd tell me,
hey,
I know you're so slow about the back check.
Just stay at the far blue line
if they dump it in.
I'm just going to wheel it
back at you and maybe you'll get a breakaway.
I think I got one in my whole career doing that,
but you tell me all the time, just stay at the
far blue line.
I get a high flip it to you.
So yeah, he was great.
Oh, perks of being a Leaf.
Did you get to meet like Mike Myers or any of
those guys?
Yeah.
So Mike and I became good buddies over the
course of our playoff runs there.
It was, it was interesting because he was wearing my jersey in the stands and made they made the introduction and what a cool dude because
and especially with your kid your kids like you get the opportunity austin powers yeah
wayne wayne and goth and it's just unbelievable the fact and and when they did that what was
their one movie there they did here in toronto where they had love, a love guru. Yeah. The kids loved that one.
They thought that was the best.
So yeah,
to meet celebrities like that,
it's always fun,
but I think it's more fun for your kids.
Like,
you know,
I know,
uh,
Justin Bieber a little bit and to have the opportunity,
he sent us some,
Oh man,
your kids must,
you're the coolest.
Send some merch,
merch to the house for the kids.
And I only got one sweatshirt out of the whole state.
Yeah.
Here's a pair of socks,
dad.
I got the slippers yeah old man slippers so like Alberta kid Oilers fan but then you become like a legendary Leafs so if they're in the playoffs like if they're in the cup final you're nervous
as hell watching right yeah you want to see them get one well being a part of like uh the group
that gets to go to the games and and sit with the fans and we need it in the city.
Like it's time.
Like the fans have been through a lot here, gotten close, had opportunities.
You know, the high stick on Dougie or the 2002 when everybody got hurt and we were so close to it.
They're itching for it, man.
They want it so bad.
And I think us as alumni, we feel the exact same way and we've got a good group here.
How can we get over the top?
You know,
that's for tree and the boys to figure out.
What do you think?
What are your thoughts here?
Come on.
I can't give you,
I can't give you what I think because I'm not close enough to know it,
but you know,
I talked earlier about that,
just that,
that ingrained want to just,
you know, Anything it takes.
Anything it takes type of attitude.
And we got some guys that we brought in that I'm hoping can fill that role,
come play off.
Benoit, was that one of them?
I like him.
I like him too.
Yeah, don't you like him?
I like him too.
I like how he knows his role.
He's like, I'm not going to score goals, boys.
And I love that he finishes every check.
Yeah.
Guy will dump the puck in the corner and he just absolutely lays on it.
But I love it.
It's amazing. The alumni group seems, and obviously you're toronto but it seems like it's
really cool shanahan was telling us everyone got like the jackets and it just seems like a core
group that that makes it real special to end up retiring here yeah brendan's done an amazing job
when he took over he made sure that the alumni felt like they're and not just that's important
two or three alumni he made sure every alumni felt like they're, and not just. That's important. Two or three alumni. He made sure every alumni felt like they had the
opportunity to be with the Leafs for their
playing career.
But also you have an opportunity to be part of
the alumni.
Comes to the alumni box, talk to the guys, see
your old buddies, reminisce, tell stories.
That's the best thing about our alumni box.
You get a few guys in there, they start telling
stories.
Oh, no.
We're going to go stick a cell phone in there
just recording.
Honestly, it would make
for its own show.
The boys just chatting
about old times,
like, you know,
the Boria and that sort of era
with Sit and Lanny
and those guys,
like what they went through
being Leafs
and then our era now.
And we get to chat about,
you know, 2002 playoffs,
what happened.
Alverson hit you from behind.
How'd you feel about it?
Just all those stories come back and that's
the best thing about having a great alumni.
There's, there's a ton of us in there all the
time.
What are you most fascinated with where the
game is today?
Like, I mean.
Love the speed, love the, like, listen, you
look at the technology and the technology that
these guys have.
I picked up a stick the other day.
I'm like, this thing doesn't, it's so light
and they can just sling it with it.
You know, I just, I just love the skill.
The skill is great.
But I do miss a little personality in the game.
Just a little, and, and not only from the
players, but the referees and, and.
Where's Mick?
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Where's Mick? Where's Cole Hall? We need some Cole Harsk's mick yeah that's what i mean where's mick
we need some koharskis that's what i mean and and even the coaches being able to say what they want
to say it's a little robotic and not get you know in trouble from you know getting a uh kicked out
of the game or or getting a spine from the league just that little bit of personality because i
think the fans miss it too yeah don't you like i yeah people probably sick of hearing me say it but yeah i just feel like it's uh it's also the
one thing uh in our game that we kind of have other than other major sports yeah i agree like
if there's like a clearing bench brawl in baseball it's like one of the things that's talked about
on sports net that night or sports and i think there's been a little bit happening you know i would say a couple times a period in the nhl yeah i don't know but i
i think i heard you talk there is a little bit more nastiness kind of creep it's creeping back
creeping back where the boys are like okay i think the league's understanding it too and i think too
and then also guys are seeing the response and the internet now and you guys are into it right
they're seeing stuff go viral and it's hard not
to be like all right well yeah get your name out there a little bit more i don't know your name
out there there's a niche for players like tom wilson they're not i know that's the thing they're
like unicorns like when they play the game but there's always that aspect of like is tom on the
ice what's he gonna what's he gonna do he could hit me or he also could take the puck away from
me and give it to obi and score like yes there's that element that maybe like those guys are like still yeah i'm very relevant but
the reason that and you went into it it's like they're all skilled and all these kids are coming
up but it's hard to be like that yep right and it's and guys don't want to have to do that so
yeah it's the mental toughness side of it too right to be able to withstand that the anxiety the way we play like i had anxiety every every pregame and i had anxiety
when it got to the point where it was like okay do i need to be that guy and i gotta continue to
be that guy i don't know if i want to be that guy that's where the anxiety came in for me and as
you get older but the game's so young now these kids are coming in and they're starting at 18 years old and boom two years after that they're making they're signing
huge tickets huge tickets and i know great for them but also that can sometimes get rid of some
of that drive a little bit oh boy that was tremendous if there's anything else we can ask
you about that you feel that you need to share i told you i want in on this golf business like i i my boys love when you guys like they've watched every one
of them and and i don't know i gotta i gotta have a word with slanny didn't he throw me under the
bus about hitting captain and the in the last one you guys did with slanny and ronan you've been he
threw me under the bus he said that was dirty. There was no penalty on the play.
I think that's memorable because he was legit,
like couldn't walk getting off.
But I thought the hip was legal, though.
Maybe a little high.
Listen, I don't know.
He hit the boards.
I hit him.
And I was going the other direction. I have to freeze frame that a little bit to see if I could be charging.
This guy talking to the department
of player safety would have been interesting yeah hang on like we're gonna freeze frame this thing
thank god they didn't have slow motion back in those days gallagher would have got a 20
but it's amazing just for you to tell us that like you didn't grow up playing the way you did
to to carve out the career you had it just shows your character and we appreciate you coming on thanks guys i appreciate you too and uh thanks
for having me on and i can't wait to play and you and stumpy thomas first me and him i'd love it so
it's stumpy thomas that's usually gonna be your i'm gonna take stumpy uh we've been partners for
years in different events and i've got stumpy and then and then where are we playing at well
coppenwood up in knucksbridge it's a great golf course. You boys will enjoy it.
Fazio Design.
And yeah, it'll be a good time.
Fucking hell.
Holy sco, baby.
Holy sco, baby.
All right, before I go any further,
here's a few words from our friends at Labatt.
Whether you're at beer league or just watching some hockey with the boys and girls,
hanging out, having a few pops,
you cannot find a better beer than a fresh Labatt Blue Light.
Lots of things are better together.
Hockey, of course.
Food with family or friends.
Golf, maybe with the wit dog.
But if you really want to take things to the next level,
drink some Labatt Blue Lights with your friends and live life to the power of we.
I can't stop thinking of me and Grinnelly talking about going back to Buffalo,
Chicklets Cup, all the time.
We've done two of them there.
Everywhere you look, Labatt, all over the place.
It's definitely a Labatt town.
I'm sure Sabres Mafia probably whacked a few back,
and hopefully they get in the playoffs and whack a few more back.
They might set a record if they do because they're hungry for the playoffs
and they're thirsty for Labatt up in Buffalo.
And remember, take a page out of the Labatt Blue Light
book and enjoy your beers together

Huge thanks to Darcy
Tucker for coming on with us, man. He was absolutely
hilarious. It's funny because a guy like
you absolutely hated when your team played against
him and then all these years later, you're hanging out shooting the show.
And he really, he really is a gregarious guy.
And you could tell he was happy to be there.
And I hope everybody enjoyed the interview.
We appreciate his time.
It's always good to get a Leaf legend on there.
And yes, it was an awesome, it was just over an hour and an awesome time with him.
Hopefully we get him on again soon down the road.
Now, actually, I don't want to say it's a mya culpa, but wit wit i've been getting a little bit of heat online about maybe interrupting you a little too much recently
i'm used to it buddy but i interrupt people too so i don't take offense you usually apologize
right away for doing it when you do to me so is there is there like a punishment let's say
like an episode i'm doing it too much like even today i felt like i've done it a couple times
is there anything that we can say to acknowledge it all right that look on your face i know i'm bad at it
i know i know hey acknowledge it is half the battle paul so we're making progress
what should be my punishment what should be my punishment i don't go on a double date with ra
okay deal fucking let's do it.
No, quickly.
But he has to bring both girls. This is paying the tab.
We went into the weeds on the Amazon stuff coming up about following the players.
Now, I didn't know we were going to kind of dive into the weeds that much on it.
Now, this is something that I met with a company about and that Amazon is doing it,
but I'm pretty sure that anybody could film something
like this and then do it with maybe less or more number of players. If you're a player in the NHL
and you would want to give access to even us or, and work with the company that I've met with
before, cause they did an incredible job on the player that we mentioned. Let's do more of this
stuff. People want this behind the scene access and the fans of teams want to see
what you guys are up to preparing for for big games important moments of the season what you're
doing with your off time like you guys are essentially celebrities in your own right
and giving that type of access is going to grow your personal brand and if you care
i know sometimes hockey players don't like ah you know fall in line with a team
it's it's becoming more and more common and it's just going to help everybody in the hockey
world and draw more eyes to this wonderful sport.
So selfishly hit us up.
We'd love to follow you around with cameras.
And once again, you would have creative control.
So the only thing that's going to see the light of day is how you want to be portrayed.
Like this is obviously like a trust thing so um yeah and then on top of the greatest great stories going on the league
wit we got to throw it over you connor fucking brown imagine a camera crew following him around
not scoring all season long hasn't scored since 2022 and then he finally gets one in a vander
cane called it pre-game on air national television with Anson Carter.
What do you think about that?
I was just so happy for the guy.
Like, to go through that, man, that is so difficult mentally.
And to understand, like, what he's gone through prior, I mean,
he signs in Washington, I believe, and then tears his ACL.
So, dude, you miss an entire season.
You're like, oh, my God.
And then you sign a one-year deal in Edmonton, and you're so excited.
I mean, you know McDavid.
You're familiar with him.
You're getting to be a part of this team with these crazy expectations.
Not only does the season start off to a disaster,
but your season starts off as a
disaster. And you're working your way back into being in the NHL. You're trying to make sure your
knee feels right, which I'm sure it didn't. Maybe it does now after this many games. But buddy,
after 10 games, oh, I got to get one. I got to get one. 20 games. Oh my God. What's happened?
30 games. The panic sets in and it just kept going and going and going.
But for a fan base that, like any Canadian market or a lot of American markets, can be
pretty hard on players, the ovation they gave him and throwing hats on the ice and the bench,
that was the coolest thing.
Nobody wants that guy to score more than himself, other than his teammates.
It's just like, we just want this guy to feel some happiness this season.
And even though our team's turned it around,
as a player, you're sitting there like,
I'm not doing anything, though.
And he's played his role,
and there's been people kind of bitching and complaining.
And at some point, you have to understand where they're coming from.
We need this guy to get a couple goals.
But all I'll say about that is when you're a team,
you're a player on a team that's going to the playoffs
and you've had a tough year,
you are so grateful that the second season is starting
because if you go and you play well in the playoffs,
none of it matters.
None of it.
Forget about the struggles and the down days
and possibly the depression you're
going through and not scoring like you're thinking financially i'm a free agent next year what am i
gonna do well buddy you go and light it up in the playoffs and nobody gives a shit the fan base is
happy the team's winning you're playing well you're gonna get another deal so like i was just
happy for a guy like it could have been a guy on any team.
But to have an injury like that and then come back and just have this much of a struggle throughout a year that after the 20 game marks, been a fantastic season.
I mean, they're one of the best teams in the league the last 30, 40 games.
And now he gets to just enjoy a little bit of it.
It's like, all right, I was able to be a part of this.
I produced. I was like somebody who scored a goal. Granted, it was a late it. It's like, all right, I was able to be a part of this. I produced. I was like somebody
who scored a goal. Granted, it was a late goal.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if it was an empty
net goal, dude. He just needed to get that one on the
score sheet, and the fans' reaction was
priceless, and the teammates congratulating
was just awesome. Awesome.
Yeah, it was just admirable
to see a guy, to be able...
Did you see the post-game interview he did?
He was just like, I'm just happy to fucking get it over with
so it's not like a topic of conversation.
He's like, you know, I was happy we were winning games
and we're in the position we're in and things are back on track.
And to be able to, you know, I could understand like that
wearing on somebody.
You said free agency.
You're getting to a new team.
You feel like you're not contributing.
The dog days.
Like I always say. You're hiding from reporters, yeah it's because you know you know it's like oh
i don't i'm just answering the same question over and over but every day he'd show up to the rink
he'd put his head down put a smile on his face work his fucking nuts off and when his number
was called he'd go out there and fucking work. And it's a very cool story.
I mean, the city of Edmonton,
that's the best hockey market going for them,
just realizing that and giving them that.
All right, what's with that smirk on your face?
No, no, just what you're talking about.
It was a dynamite team.
It was a two-minute ovation.
It was so good, man.
So good, yeah.
It was such a feel-good moment.
And man, you can understand why.
I think Connor obviously has say in who's around to
some degree.
And this year they brought in him calm,
demetered,
hardworking guy.
Same with the coach,
calm,
demetered,
hardworking guy,
never fucking too high,
never too low.
Just surround yourself with good people.
And they got,
they got a good,
a good galvanized group right now.
They all love each other.
They're all ready to go.
And it was an amazing story.
The Wittog made a return to NHL arenas this week,
because I don't know if you caught it.
That team owns me.
The Las Vegas Golden Knights own me.
They knocked out the Oilers last year.
They went to the Stanley Cup.
Their first year as an organization,
their first year in the league,
they were playing me say on NHL Network,
they're going to be the doormats
for the entire league
throughout the season.
They had that planned
before the games.
They've gone on
in this incredible run
the past few years.
And now,
they're putting my Instagram video
or my Twitter video
up on the big screen
and they're changing the words
to me saying,
I love the Vegas Golden Knights.
They're manipulating it
just like the fucking cap.
And sorry for interrupting you.
They're AI-ing you. They're AIing my ass.
And I saw that.
I was like, well, I saw a tweet.
Like, thanks for the kind words.
I was like, what the hell?
I was like, oh, my God.
These motherfuckers.
These motherfuckers own me.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
The most ridiculous thing, and I shouldn't be surprised,
is like I tweeted lawsuit incoming.
And people are like, dude, you fucking baby laughing a joke. I'm just kidding. I'm't be surprised, is I tweeted lawsuit incoming, and people are like,
dude, you fucking baby laughing a joke.
They're just kidding.
I'm like, oh, you don't say, dude.
Oh, is he actually calling my lawyer, you dumb fucks?
I would have if I would have had that hairline on the Jumbotron.
Who's that old guy in a nursing home bitching about the Golden Knights?
That's a nice couch for a nursing home.
Those people on the top deck of the stadium
looking at that bump chin stare them like an IMAX lens.
The funny thing was, you had to think 90 of the crowd.
Who the fuck is this guy?
What is going on?
Why is there a dog that looks like a pillow behind this guy?
They're fucking savages, man.
They put out the eyeball emoji before they circumcised the cap
and got Thomas Hurdle.
They're going to have some tweet, some amazing way to announce
Mark Stone's playing game one of the first round.
Oh, I'm crying out loud.
Fucking internet's going to burn down. I'm crying out loud. Internet's going to burn down.
Crying out loud.
You know what would be unreal?
If they did like a ceremony, like somebody got married before the game
and then Stone came out in full gear and like did the,
what do you call the guy who reads the stuff at the front?
The sermon?
The priest?
A priest?
Oh, the priest.
Yeah, the priest.
No, but what do you call a guy who does a wedding? Don't they have a different name than priest? The priest? Oh, the priest. Yeah, the priest. No, but what do you call a guy who does a wedding?
Don't they have a different name than priest?
Well, Justice of the Peace, if it was a non-denominational.
Do you think that the league would find him if they actually rolled him out in a wheelchair
with a blanket like that WWE thing and he hopped up and started buzzing around?
Talk about an all-time troll.
The league would have to find him, right?
I don't know, man, but you're on fire today.
Imagine if Stone's like, I don't know if I want to do this.
Like, get in, Bill Foles.
Like, get in the fucking wheelchair.
Shut your mouth.
Oh, fuck.
Jesus Christ.
I don't think you and the brain are fucking,
sit in the fucking wheelchair.
How do you think we got that extra money to do this crazy shit? We got to sell some fucking, this is entertainment, bitch. Get in the fucking wheelchair. How do you think we got that extra money to do this crazy shit?
We're going to sell some fucking.
This is entertainment, bitch.
Get the fucking wheelchair.
You want to pass the puck to Hurl and sit the fuck down.
Or I'll break your other leg.
Oh, shit.
G just sent this over.
Florida's Dimitri Kulikov suspended for two games for an illegal check to the head on Timber Bay's
connoisseur. Yeah. Sussy for a head
check. Subban was pretty opinionated
about that one, eh?
Oh yeah, he was over
Dubas too last week. Goofing on about
his glasses and shit.
What do you guys make
of the head? Do you think the rest of the game
would have been enough? You said they gave
him two extra games?
Yeah, two games suspended suspended i thought one or two i called the rempy four games though when i went back on with g that night yes you did yeah and i and i actually stand
by it like okay so you know what my since we're on the the legal check to the head topic i'm okay
with one or two games for him uh suban said it
shouldn't have been i actually think that the rempe one was was uh less of one for the simple
fact of i'm okay with him getting the four games but i totally view as him coming across the ice
in that manner and then realizing last second that he probably could have done more damage
and then his arms kind of came up to, to, um,
to,
to like protect himself to bumping into the glass.
And then he ends up clipping them.
He just,
we can agree on going into the glass.
You'd put your arms up like this.
You wouldn't go like this to brace yourself for the glass.
Well, I mean,
if you're a guy who like slows down the video frame by frame,
like the rest of the idiots online,
I guess maybe so.
Buddy,
when you're, if you were to ever trip on your own fucking two feet i'm going to the boy you go
into the wall in your house you put your hands in front of you how would putting your elbow to the
side protect you because i think i think that he was committed to the fucking hit and then bailed
out last second and you said you just said the opposite
to brace himself to go into the wall what do you mean he the only contact he made was when his
arms were coming up to put them in front of himself before he hits the glass right can we
all agree can we all agree i'm gonna hit the glass oh it's skating skating i'm gonna hit the glass
and this guy's chin with my elbow maybe i should watch it again maybe you're right
he bails out of the hit he clips his head it's an illegal check to the head he ended up getting
him but he decommitted from the damage that he could have done. He clips him as a result of
putting his arms up to protect himself
going into the glass.
Your kid just showed up?
Yeah. Which one?
Ryder or Squanko?
Ask him what he thinks of the hit.
He's like, good, good. Hit him harder.
Shut the fuck up,
dad.
Give me some fucking Pringles and shut the fuck up
i've been talking to fudge kid he was right here there's these like there's like these fake
pringles like i i was like oh let's try these like healthier pringles oh worst thing i've ever
tasted i don't even remember the name of the company but if you see can like pringles and
their chips don't even consider buying them. They're trash.
So I agree to disagree on the hit.
And then I think that was all right.
Do you have an opinion on it?
I just said one or two games would have been fine.
I didn't think it was excessive for the first one.
As far as rent pay, I predicted three games, four, probably a little bit more than I thought.
But it was, yeah, chicken wings are dirty man
you can't be doing that shit, you know, knock it off
you guys were okay when fucking
Trouba was doing it to Sid
you didn't hear you then
we were, I was never okay with that
I think we were live streaming that game
Jets fans
weren't happy with us last week
we cut something after dress rehearsal
Tyler Toffoli traded.
It got lost in the shuffle there.
Hell of a pickup.
He come over.
He was leading the Devils in goals with 26.
He's already hit 30.
He's got four goals already.
They also picked up Colin Miller.
I mean, this team has just got so much better picking up on a hand.
And fucking now Toffoli, he's a playoff fucking scorer.
A three-time 30-goal scorer.
I don't know, man.
I feel like this is another team people might be sleeping on,
even though they're, you know, better the't know, man. I feel like this is another team people might be sleeping on, even though they're at the top of the fucking...
I always like to compare.
They're that team of the West.
It's kind of like Carolina,
where I feel like these might have been a little bit unexpected,
much like even the whole season
and how they ended up signing their two big dogs.
So the fact that they were able to add a Stanley Cup champion,
a guy who um you know
has the ability to go in to a new lineup and automatically see results like that's not always
easy all the time either and i want to say behind um who's the russian guy in calgary
who's lighting it up sarah sharon govich i think Toffoli was the only guy to go to a new team
and score less goals than Sharon Govich
in his move over to the Devils.
So it's like, what do they need?
They're a team that kind of has that 2-1 mentality,
3-2 mentality.
So getting a big goal scorer, to me,
was like them getting against compared to carolina
in the league and and then and then adding more depth up the middle was monahan much like they
did with kuznetsov so two huge ads for a team who's had an unexpected season and who i don't
know man i don't not looking like frauds to me no and i and I never said they were. Now, question.
Well, two questions that I don't know if you...
No, one statement, one question.
First, I'll go with the question.
Right now, this could be really stupid.
Right now, Hellebuck, he's wrapped up the Vezna.
Yeah.
He leads the league in goals against,
and he leads the league in save percentage.
Has that?
I'm sure it's happened before.
When was the last time that happened?
And it could have been last year.
I have no idea with Allmark, but
leading in both seems
outstanding, to
say the least, no?
I think G's going to look it up right now.
Okay, my statement.
Probably the most...
Tim Thomas, I'm going to guess.
Really? You think that long?
What, in 10-11?
If not that year, around there.
But yeah, there's probably,
so many fucking good goalies.
So, I think that
more than any other
division,
winning the Central
is the most important, right?
Because it's just,
so whoever wins it, you're either you're right so whoever wins it you're either
playing colorado winnipeg um or dallas right so it's like just to be able to dodge one of those
teams oh yeah it's like and then and then and then one of those teams takes out the other
and you're able now granted nashville's great if vegas is somehow a wild card team it does
la like it's a better matchup than one of those three.
Yeah, like you're saying, because if Edmonton ends up finished second in the Pacific,
they can end up matching up against LA, which is like, yeah, it's a difficult matchup,
but it ain't going against...
I think most people would probably have Dallas and Colorado in their top five Stanley Cup
picks, if not top three.
And Winnipeg fans are screaming, like, why aren't we?
Which I think they have a right to be based on this year.
If you're one of those teams, it's Winnipeg that wants to dodge the other
two.
And I think that any fucking sane Winnipeg Jets fan would agree with
exactly what you're saying.
And it's a wonderful statement.
I feel like Winnipeg would have maybe a better chance at beating Dallas than Colorado.
Like, Colorado's just so fast.
Can Winnipeg skate with them?
I don't know.
But with Hellebuck, it's like, buddy, we could beat anyone.
That's the main point around this.
Kind of similar to the Rangers, Mr. Sturkin.
Like, the Rangers, buddy, are...
I've brought them up randomly,
I think twice or three times this pod.
They are fucking unbelievable.
I saw Lazarus tweet, like,
everyone's talked nonstop about the Panthers
since January 1st.
The Rangers are...
They have the same exact record.
So the Rangers and then having that goalie and having
him turn around this season,
similar to the Jets with maybe even
more talent up front.
The Jets don't have a
Panarin, dude.
We're going to talk about a couple
other Midwest teams. Minnesota and St.
Louis, because they were way out of the playoffs
various points of the season. Right now,
Minnesota, they're five back with no games
at hand. I don't know if they're going to get in, but we're going to talk about
Kaprizov, man. He had a real slow start to
the season. He's been absolutely on fire.
I think he's had 35 goals.
Do you think they actually get in, though, Biz, Minnesota?
No,
but just an incredible,
just a great culture. We talk
always about their amnesty buyouts,
the 14 million they have working against them.
That's a lot of money.
And the fact that they're still in the mix and competing,
and it also shows just a lot of like the culture in the locker room.
Like they never gave up on their season.
Like a lot of things were not going their way.
And, you know, they even got rid of a few guys at the deadline,
but that didn't really affect anything that was going on internally
and how they were going to approach these, you know, these final 20, after the deadline. So it's been awesome to see, buddy, like even from that amazing moment, the first time we'd ever seen a goalie pulled in overtime to make it a four on three with flower. I don't think they've lost or the first loss that they sustained after that was an overtime loss or maybe shootout against the St. Louis Blues, the other team.
They're kind of competing with that wild card.
But since they pulled off that stunt, they've gotten points in every game.
And it's been a blast to watch.
And who knows?
We never know what's going to happen with Marc-Andre Fleury, right?
I don't think it's his last year.
But to see that he's getting to enjoy his final days, if it is,
and him kind of getting to share the net and be relevant
and playing unreal in the second half of the season,
I think it's special and it's cool.
And if it is the end and that's how he goes out,
fucking rights, he deserves it.
So I do not think, though,
they will be cracking the playoff roster.
They've just dug themselves too deep.
But a great run to make it interesting.
And even the Blues,
I don't think anyone expected them
to be somewhat in the hunt right now.
How about...
I saw Mike Russo retweeted someone.
So Kucherov was first star of the week.
Bedard was second.
Fleury was third.
And I don't know if somebody mentioned him
or he mentioned.
Bedard and Fleury's age difference has to be the most
in the history of the NHL for like stars of the week.
Fleury's 21 years older than him.
Wow.
Or 20 years older than him.
That's kind of crazy, right?
Yeah, that is a big difference.
I'm trying to think if record.
And I don't even know how long the league's done,
you know, three stars of the week, but just to
see that age difference, pretty cool.
I want to talk about another kid
on Minnesota, Brock Faber. Have you ever
seen much of this kid this year? He's
one of the best rookies in the league.
He's like Charlie McAvoy, dude.
And he
I don't think he's as physical,
but any other season
or not, I can't talk.
Bedard is going to win Rookie of the Year.
Bedard should wear a full shield the rest of his career.
He's unstoppable when he fucking wears this thing.
World Juniors, NHL.
I ain't going to chirp him.
No.
The guy's getting five points the other night.
He's just incredible.
He's lived up to the expectations, I think.
I think he has on a horrible, horrible team.
You could brand it so well, call him Bubble Boy.
Bubble Boy.
That's the nickname every NHL has always wanted.
I hope to grow up and make the NHL
and have the nickname Bubble Boy.
But Faber could win Rookie of the Year
so many other different seasons what
i'm saying like 25 minutes a game he's playing against the other team's top line he's producing
points he is an unreal player and perf and i think it was part of the fiala trade because la drafted
him it must have been the fiala deal yeah like yeah kind of whoops but all for what they need like they had time they have tons
of guys up front like to have a d you need you need good d what the fuck are they gonna do when
dowdy's gone yeah he's well they have they have that brant clark coming that's what but this kid
oh crazy hockey iq i the first time i saw him was a game, a Minnesota game.
It was on the Big Ten Network last year.
I was like, holy shit.
And just the way he controls the pace and how good of a stick he has,
great skater.
And he looks like McAvoy too.
Look up these dudes' pictures.
They look exactly alike.
What are you trying to say, Witt?
They actually share the same business manager as well, Witt. They look exactly alike. What are you trying to say, Witt? They actually share the same
business manager as well, Witt.
Kind of ironic there.
Have you ever seen them in the same place
at the same time?
No.
No, I haven't.
I talked enough about Faber. I want to talk
about Connor Bubble Boy Bedard.
Here he comes
to save the day.
Yeah, first five.
I'm here to save the Blackhawks organization.
It is Bubble Boy.
Yoki, what you spoke before the show today?
A lot.
I got this new kush.
It's a cherry fade.
It's called.
I'm faded, dog.
Fucking A, buddy.
Yeah, he had his first five-point game of his career. He had
Three points in the previous game eight points over
Two games, but there was a great scene
When they were playing the Ducks when it was a little scrap
Going on and you know, Marazic got involved
With it then Gibson had a skate all the way down the other end
And you can see him and Marazic kind of grab each other
But two veterans who better out far they were basically
Like laughing at each other's face like this is fucking
So silly just a funny clip. What did you see
That last whole the Ducks
who was laughing?
Morazic and fucking Gibson like they didn't square up
but they were holding each other up just because
Morazic had balls too. Gibson was grabbing the back
of his head like scratching him it didn't
seem like it was like a big
time joking around
is this another movie review?
is that actually
what happened?
he reached around another movie review? Is that actually what happened? Yeah.
He was trying to get
a rest.
He reached around,
grabbed his head.
Ari's making it sound
like they were like,
buddy, where'd you go
to dinner last night?
Did you see OV out?
No.
He was trying to
fucking dummy him.
Send us the clip, G.
Could there be a worse
person at describing events?
Oh, it's crazy.
Could you imagine
being a cop
taking a statement
from Ari
that you'd write
down the cops are usually arresting them oh yeah no actually what happened sir
jeez let me let me light this joint here before i talk talk to you about what happened you got a
lighter officer i don't i don't have a record let me go in this grocery store 10 minutes past
it closed and create a ruckus and then look at them weird when they question me for being here and taking my time.
Now back to the movie review.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, I'm actually getting questions about the robbery.
I'd be surprised that they're giving me attitude.
You guys see poor things yet?
Did you send me the video?
No, but I watched The Holdovers.
The Holdovers is an incredible movie.
Incredible movie. Paul Giamatti Holdovers is an incredible movie. Great flick, wasn't it?
Incredible movie.
Paul Giamatti, who's an unreal actor,
he's this really miserable kind of curmudgeonly old professor at this school,
and he gets stuck having to stay at school over a Christmas holiday
with the kids who can't go home or whose parents don't want him home.
It's an awesome flick.
Did you watch the one about
the brain transplant
last week that Ari was telling us?
No. That was a great description too.
Of what I just gave?
No, Ari describing that
movie. Although I never heard from
one person online about whether
it was a good breakdown or not. So
the book is still out on your movie reviews.
Okay, so now I'm watching.
Here comes Gibson down the ice to get
Mrazik. Watch when he grabs his
head. Tell me if
you think they're just joking around a couple
old vets catching up for old times.
Wait, what?
I could have sworn I seen one of them smiling
but I got it on my glasses.
Look at Gibson. He's like lollygagging down there.
The point is, I don't think either one of them were very fucking serious about it.
So he has a jersey.
Then he let him go.
Gibson would have fought him 100 if he could have gotten to him.
I think Gibson's kind of like smiling like, I'm going to dummy you.
Yeah, no, I don't think there's much camaraderie going on there.
It's more like, let go of my fucking guys,
and then we can both fuck off to each other's nets.
Not a lot of tummy sticks going on there, Mr. Movie Review.
Either way, we're due for a fucking goalie fight.
I'm actually looking for a message.
I did get someone who chimed in that they did watch poor things
and said they enjoyed it.
It was a fucking dynamite movie.
They didn't bitch about my fucking description like you guys.
We just like giving you a hard time.
I'm sure you would have read
a text from somebody that said, I watched that movie.
It fucking sucked.
Guys, before we continue,
I need to talk to you about G4.
The legendary golf footwear
innovator G4 just dropped their latest, the Galavant Tour.
It's made to seriously upgrade your golf game.
Combining two of G4's best-selling designs, the Galavant Tour brings together two shoes we all know and love.
The stylish Galavanter and the ultra-comfortable MG4 Plus, making a dreamy waterproof golf shoe.
ultra comfortable MG4 Plus, making a dreamy waterproof golf shoe. The unique cleat system named G-Pod provides increased traction and torque in the signature G4 pops of color.
And with 13 points of contact with the ground, weight is evenly dispersed for unparalleled
stability on the course. You got to use the ground in your golf swing. People say it all the time.
I don't do it nearly, nearly enough, but it's using that ground as force to explode up and into it, and it makes it easy with G4.
It comes in a variety of styles, and there's one for every golfer out there.
Most of us got the camo version, while Grinelli got the version with contrasting tuxedo stripes.
Whether you're looking for pops of color, camouflage soles, or a touch of tradition with long-ed brogues, there's a new Galavant Tour for you.
Check out g4.com slash chicklets.

Hey, another piece of footage and a lot of controversy going on is this,
what was it, a high school hockey game at the Garden?
I got a couple messages about this.
This is exactly what happened.
If anyone saw in New Jersey, I believe last week or the week before,
in the semifinals of the state tournament, a team threw up a ball,
buzzer went off after the kid had released it, bucket.
They win.
Nope.
Ref said no basket, no basket.
It was a joke. One of the worst calls
you've ever seen in your life. It should have been a basket?
It should have been a basket.
The thing with that one was they called it a basket
first and then all the refs
met up together and then they said
it was a basket, which is even crazier.
I don't think they watched.
They must have just talked. Well, lead us into
and in the end, the team who won that game
even though they didn't technically win, they ended up winning the state championship, I saw, too.
But so final game, Division I, Massachusetts High School Hockey State Championship game.
St. John's Prep's a private school.
It's a Catholic school, right, G?
Yeah, they're a wagon.
They're in there every year.
They're at the top of the Massachusetts High School. Always a good team.
And Winchester's a public school.
It's actually where my dad grew up. I lived there until I was
two years old. No big deal.
Kirk Minahan from the
Unnamed Show. He's a guy who grew up in
Winchester. So they go on this
unreal run, dude, to get to
the finals of the state
title, state championship game.
Huge underdogs. Brian Yandleson plays on CM.
They were big underdogs to them. They beat them pretty handily. Then they moved on again,
beat another team that was supposed to be pretty good, Arlington Catholic.
So they go to the finals, dude. It's two to two. I guess it's a great game back and forth.
And right at the end of the third period a kid on st john's
prep gets the puck on his stick now they don't have the buzzer go off like it would at the
bruins games this was at the garden so right as the clock goes to zero it's a loud huge horn
well they didn't have that i guess it's like somewhat delayed it's a very faint one too
very faint but clearly clearly while the puck is still on this kid's stick,
the light goes off behind the net.
Period over.
He shoots it, goes in, boom.
Celebration going wild.
No goal, no goal, no goal there.
The buzzer had blown.
The game was over.
We were going to overtime.
The refs huddle up.
Goal!
And it stands. And
Winchester, the Satriums of
Winchester get robbed
in an unfair ruling
by the referees on the ice. Now,
they don't have
goal judges, dude. Grinelli's telling you.
Insane! They got rid of
goal judges, man.
The MIAA.
Talk about an organization being down bad.
These fools can't get out of their own way.
Oh, no.
They recently, a former producer of the Minahan Show,
he does like TikToks now about high school sports,
culling in.
He's out of his mind.
But he put up one recently that I think had a ton of traction of a kid
from Nantucket.
There's like a scrum in the middle of the game.
The whistle blows, and he has the puck on his stick,
and he shoots the puck at one of the kids on the other team on the ice,
and he didn't shoot it that hard.
Like 100 kick him out of that game if you want.
It probably would have been a penalty in the NHL because it wasn't off the ice and it wasn't that hard.
But no doubt, if you kick him out of that game, I don't think anyone says you were.
Yeah, defuse the situation.
No big deal.
Buddy, the MIAA, these clowns, they not only kicked the kid out of the game, they kicked
him off the, he was suspended the rest of the season and this kid plays tennis.
He's a senior at Nantucket High.
He can't even play tennis. Whoa. Wait, he's suspended next season too. He got suspended for next hockey season as well. No, I. He's a senior at Nantucket High. He can't even play tennis.
Wait, he's suspended next season too.
He got suspended for next hockey season as well.
No, I think he's a senior.
He's a senior.
Okay.
He's a senior.
So there's nothing more to the story about this kid being a piece of shit?
No, nothing?
No, they just ended this kid's athletic career in high school
because he can't even play tennis in the spring.
For like muffling a Ryan Whitney point shot at some kid's fucking foot in the middle of a scrum.
Then Nantucket, the kid wore number two, so they put number two stickers on their helmet.
M-I-A-A, take those stickers off your helmet.
You're not allowed to wear them.
This is a clown show, these people.
Fuck them. Massachusetts Interscholactic whatever the fuck.
Athletic Association needs to be thrown in the trash.
Reboot it.
Turn the computer off.
Shut down computer.
Just what we need.
Another enemy.
Let's go.
And it's tough to blame the refs because these refs are getting a ton of shit.
And I talked to a guy who was in the scorer box.
And he said, I felt bad because they came over to the scorers table to have their discussion and all
of them were like yeah i can't determine one way or the other because it's hard to determine when
the horn went off because of how difficult it was to hear at ice level now having a goal judge is a
whole nother story the fact that they don't have goal judges here i know which okay okay video
replay so you're so they're not using video replay in an
nhl arena is fucking mind right minnesota does it why can't we okay okay right okay so you're
saying that the refs who huddled obviously didn't have access to any video that would have showed
them the light going off before he released the puck so this is the the text that i got about it
or or dm hey biz i just saw Mike's blog on the MI,
MIAA state championship.
I was a linesman on the game and wanted to reach out to you since you've
probably talk about it on the pod today.
It was a bad situation for everyone and the crew feels horrible,
but the problem is with the MIAA.
So I want to make sure the refs don't get sewered.
There's no goal judges anywhere. They
used to have them. The horn is very quiet and
delayed and at least a full second and no replay
even though we're in a pro barn. Like Mike
mentioned in the blog, the ref that was on the
goal line was in perfect position and has been
working hockey East for 10 plus years so he's no
schmuck. He's one of the nicest guys we'll ever meet and really cares about getting
everything right.
And when he's out there,
he was shaken up after seeing the video in the locker room after soak.
He was certainly doesn't agree to be ripped on happy to give you more info if
needed.
So obviously these refs are taking the shrapnel.
Now,
are you saying that M IAA don't have goal judges,
especially as you get that deep into the championship?
At least in the championship game.
Right.
Are you saying because they're just being cheap?
And is this also an organization that's bending them over
for all these fees to even be associated to this fucking league?
In Massachusetts, you work,
99 of kids will not play after high school hockey you work your entire fucking life
all you care about is playing at the garden for the state championship saint patty's day
7 p.m 8 p.m the whole city's there there's nothing fucking better and then for them to get robbed
like this these kids these seniors work their whole fucking life for this moment and they got
robbed because the mia doesn't want to spend uh pay someone 15 an hour to sit behind the net to be the goal
judge.
And then the fact that they're live streaming this game, they're videoing this game.
So at any point, someone from the MIA could have called down to the box and said, hey,
let's review the video.
Why aren't we reviewing the video?
I know it says in the rules you can't review video,
but the rules are antiquated.
It's 2024.
Like, what the fuck are we doing?
These kids were robbed.
You know the president of the MIA
is cruising around in his fucking drop-top Mazda Miata
right now smoking a stoke.
He didn't give a fucking care in the world
as long as he's fucking making his fucking 200K a year
bending all these people over not to
mention this this this organization or association so forever massachusetts high school hockey
they had the super eight right so based on school size you're it depends that that puts you in a
division right there's division five four three two. But no matter what school size there was, they picked the eight best teams.
So you could have a division three team that was unbelievable make it to the Super 8, right?
So they'd pick the eight best teams, and then every other team would go into the division,
try to win that division state title.
But the Super 8 champ was the big dog state champ.
But those are usually the Catholic schools, too.
Those are the private schools.
Yeah, but there'd be public schools in there. There'd be public schools. There's usually one or two, but the public schools champs. too those are the private schools in there there's
usually one or two but the public schools in there yeah one or two buddy a couple years ago
they got rid of the super eight wanna know why wasn't inclusive enough it wasn't inclusive
what do you mean they didn't want they public schools? Dude, what do I mean?
Exactly.
These fucking idiots, dude.
It wasn't inclusive enough.
It was like talking about like a...
I don't even like...
If you're using the word inclusive
when you're talking about like a high school hockey tournament,
I think you've probably lost your mind.
But that's Massachusetts, dude.
As a resident of Massachusetts...
Where are they doing the finals?
It's a top notch.
Massachusetts is becoming more and more
a top notch shitty state to live in.
I'll tell you that right now.
Joel Osteen should build a barn
and do it at his place.
Do you agree, all right?
You don't even pay taxes.
That's why you agree.
I did it for a long time. No, I don't even pay taxes that's why you agree i didn't for a long time no i i don't
agree i don't agree i think i i love i love massachusetts there's not too many other places
i'd rather yeah i i don't know man i mean i mean i don't have kids and i'm not involved with school
systems and all that fucking penthouse bullshit so i don't know i don't have to deal with that
but no i i fucking love this state man i love boss you know i wouldn't know who i don't love
is the fucking people at the MIA right now.
It's deteriorating at a pace that's a little ridiculous in my mind.
Okay.
That's all I'm saying.
And not to mention.
Oh, you're going high level.
You're talking from a state representative.
It's just a shit show.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
And I'm not going to get political right now.
I'm not going to do it no i it's a no i
i have no say i like arizona you know why i like arizona it's not very political no one really
talks about politics here the tax rate's i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure there are people
politics you're just not yeah but it's fucking hard cores that live out in cave creek like no one other other like no one you never see any uproar about nothing really here
tax rates low no everyone's always in a good mood could be could because of the sun and how it's
properly and how you're not fighting for parking spaces and how you can go on wonderful hikes
nice highways nice highways maybe you guys should all move out here and relax a little. Let's move on.
Fuck the MIA.
Pulling up stakes.
Hey, Whit, did you know what the old boss had gotten back in the day?
If you knew the right guy, you could actually bet on the high school games
that would be played in the building.
Really?
Yeah, it was one of the old black guys.
No, I was one of his customers.
That was his old black guy.
He did maintenance.
He'd just walk up.
I forget what his name was. He'd say, hey, Jim old black guy. He did like maintenance. And he'd just walk up and, hey, I forget what his name is.
You say, hey, Jim or whatever.
He'd be like, yep.
And I want Don Bosco to make 25.
So you give him the 28 bucks.
And if you won, you'd get that back plus the 25.
Legit was taking an action.
That's old school.
High school game.
Way old school.
As far as your question, with the last goaltender to lead in save percentage
and goals against Alex Nadelkovich of the 2021 season.
But, Caroline.
I'm talking about, like, how many games did he play?
I should have said minimum 50 games started or something,
40 games started.
But I doubt he had that.
Yeah, G sent it over.
I didn't get the whole stat line.
But you know what?
G did his job.
I didn't ask the clear question.
That one's on me.
I had my guy.
Oh, quickly,
considering we're talking about
non-hockey,
non-NHL hockey related news,
University of New Brunswick.
I think they went...
Why are you doing that?
They might be the best college hockey.
I know it's Canadian University,
but they might be the best Canadian University ever.
Ever.
They didn't lose a single game this year.
Really?
I think that they could beat the best NCAA team.
You're an idiot.
They could.
That's crazy.
But wait, wait.
They didn't even allow a goal in their championship series.
The whole playoffs that they just played they
didn't allow a single goal that's your fucking money where your mouth let's get these guys
when the national championship is crowned the states and even though now the university of
new brunswick's gonna have this long layover where they're getting sauced up they're probably
getting their wieners sucked off their torso right now from every fucking sorority sister at unb
because they deserve it let's get
them back on the ice I'll fucking fund that shit whenever you want Canadian boys can do
their schedule usually those teams come and play like a hockey east or a d1 team locally but I
don't think they did this year yeah because they would have fucking embarrassed them shout out to
UNB undefeated all season long. That's incredible.
Crowns of Canada.
And like I said, man,
I'd put those motherfuckers up against any of you American boys.
They won last year, too.
So they won the championship last year,
then didn't lose a single game all season long, and then didn't allow a goal in the playoffs.
That's how fucking good they are.
That's dropping your nuts on Canadian hockey right now.
Shout out to the UNB boys.
A couple more notes here.
There's your coworker, Anson Carter.
He's spearheading the charge.
Hopefully get Atlanta a third expansion team,
see if third time's a charm.
They build that new stadium in Alpharetta.
So, Biz, what do you think Atlanta's chances are?
Again, if the NHL does expand, do you think Atlanta is...
For this type of information, I mean,
we even go back to the coyotes,
like new arenas,
like all this like high level conversation going on.
I trust everything I've been hearing from Ace.
He's confident that Atlanta is getting hockey back.
I agree with him that it's a market like from a TV perspective and the
population.
I like anything you need solid ownership.
You need a good arena location location and that seems to be what
they have in Atlanta ready to go obviously um I think the league really likes to be in control
when the news about thing comes out and I think that it came out from the the ownership group
and and Anson's side isn't there two of them no I don't think that Anson's group's the one that's
being taken way more seriously.
And the fact that they can actually, and they have money and funding and everything in place.
Who's the big money behind that one, Biz?
That's a question for people who know what the fuck they're talking about.
Oh, is that not out there?
That would be a conversation for Anson.
I wouldn't be able to tell you those names exactly who they are.
Oh, I thought they were made. conversation for Anson. Like I wouldn't be able to tell you those names exactly who they are, but he would be able to, he's kind of like, he's one of those guys that just seems to be a part of
the team and assembling the team and getting everybody together. I don't know how many
minority owners are going to have there. It's just happening. And it's way more, it's way more far
along than any other group. And it's being taken highly seriously but bill daly came out with a statement
basically saying like hey nothing's for sure yet like everybody kind of calmed down because once
again i think that the league likes having control anyway i think you guys get my drift right i do
yeah okay that definitely seems like expansion is coming even if a lot of people don't want 34 teams
oh buddy i think we're going to fucking 36 i think that the fact i you know what else is fucking crazy is the fact that in the last
cba or whenever the players don't get a goddamn cent of any of that they're going to keep doing
that by the time they get 35 and 36 teams it's going to be a billion and a half and they're
fucking itching their asses for fucking escrow suck my dick
fuck you yeah and elliot told us players put your fucking put your fucking ads on this
put your fucking ads on this you greedy motherfuckers right there fucking cry
we're gonna claw back uh eight percent from the players while we're fucking flying on our private jet going to see Taylor Swift backstage.
Fuck you.
No.
Am I crazy here?
No.
You are.
You're a billion and a half and you're not going to pay.
That's amazing.
That's great.
Yeah.
Fucking greed.
Greedy motherfuckers.
At least get these retired guys some fucking insurance.
Thank you.
Fucking right.
For paving the way for your fucking private jets.
Imagine they used to be when there were 21 teams,
16 of them made the playoffs.
There were only five teams that didn't make the playoffs
way back in the day.
Pretty crazy fucking thing of it now.
You were around for that.
Buffalo would still find a way to miss.
Yeah, 16 out of 21.
That was fucking bananas.
Blues GM Doug Armstrong is the
team candidate GM. He'll obviously put the
team together for the Olympics and all the other international
stuff going on in the interim.
Caps coach Marty St. Louis, he's
taking a personal leave from his job
for a little bit. He's got some family matters he's going to tend to, so
hopefully everything's going good for you, Marty.
Wayne Simmons hung him up
after 15 NHL seasons with six teams,
526 points and 1,037 regular season teams.
What a fucking nail gun that guy was.
Oh, my God.
You'd see him off ice.
He was real thin.
He was born to be a flyer.
He was the perfect flyer, that guy.
Perfect flyer.
The perfect flyer.
He loved, it seemed like he loved fighting.
He just fucking threw bombs the entire time
and somehow was strong as an ox,
even though it looked like there wasn't much muscle on his body.
He was 170 pounds strong as a guy.
It didn't make any sense.
It didn't make any sense.
Just, all right, to go back to him, though,
like, what's the matter?
Were you reading off some stats?
No, go ahead, go ahead. No, I just wanted to him, though, like, what's the matter? Were you reading off some stats? No, go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, I just wanted to pump his tires, man.
Like, this guy, he was an incredible forward, unreal on the walls,
like, net front presence, could take punishment, could fight,
good guy in the law, like, just everything you want in a teammate,
and he fucking did it.
And like you said, he's a fucking nail gun, and I always go back.
My only story about Wayne Simmons is one time i didn't get it off on the half wall and i knew it was
probably going to be my last shift of the game and i i fumble fucked it at the blue line they
got us hemmed in and after the shift i fucking broke my stick over my knee and he goes oh easy
tough guy right in my face after i'm sucking wayne he just hemmed me in. So fuck you Wayne Simmons
for that one, but a hell of a career
buddy. Hey, and when he said it,
Scott Hartnell started laughing in my face.
Motherfucker, that guy too.
How about this? The run he had
starting in 2011-12,
his first year as a flyer.
28 goals.
Then the 12-13
is a lockout year, right? It was 15 goals, 45 games. Next year, 29 goals. Next year, 28 goals. Yeah. Then the 12-13 is a lockout year, right?
It was 15 goals, 45 games.
Next year, 29 goals.
Next year, 28 goals.
Next year, 32 goals.
Next year, 31 goals.
You know what he did that making?
Four million bucks.
All those seasons.
I know he got fucked on the timing of his deals.
All those seasons, over 100 pims besides the lockout one.
So a power forward to the core.
And dude, yeah, he never had a pop-off year
like the year of unrestricted or restricted free agency.
He's a guy that you probably look up,
you're like, oh, he probably made 40, 50,
and he didn't.
Let's give a couple clicks for Wayne Simmons
being the most under-fucking-paid warrior
to ever do it right there.
Couple clicks for the Wayne train.
Yeah, for a lanky guy, he sure could chuck him.
He's going to sign one of those ceremonial one-day contracts
with the Flyers on April 13th,
and they're going to honor him before the game that night.
The Flyers are back.
Torrance might put him in the game.
He is.
No, I already talked to him.
Grats again, Wayne.
Good stuff.
They unveiled the Mike Medano statue over the weekend
down in Dallas Saturday night.
I don't know what took him so long, but obviously that franchise.
That statue is one of the best statues.
Sometimes statues aren't great.
They don't necessarily look good.
Dude, they got his old CCM tacks perfectly.
Everyone knows the wheels Madonna wore.
They got the jersey flapping in the wind, and then his skate.
Oh, buddy.
He's got five kids now.
I don't wear a golf glove because the first
time I ever played golf with him years ago, I don't think he had
any kids yet. He shot like
67 at LA Country Golf with no
glove on. I'm like, what the fuck? You don't need to wear
a golf glove. And this guy,
man, all-time legend. I think a lot
of people have him. It's like him
and Kane as the top two Americans ever,
I'd say, and the perfect guy to have
a statue in Dallas. And that guy
who designed it crushed
that statue. The skates,
getting the skates that
correct is just like, as a nerd
gear, I was like, oh my god, what
a touch. What about the jersey
flapping in the wind? That's to me
what he was known for on the ice. He always had
that jersey.
It's kind of like when a girl walks down the aisle,
you know, they have that big,
their dress, it just drapes behind them.
Remember he got Ben Stiller
when they were taking him off the ice
in the fucking gurney
and they dropped him.
Remember that scene?
Yeah.
It was like out behind the arena.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's like,
if Twitter was around during that,
oh my God.
Just like that, the summer ball, he was around during that. Oh my God. Uh,
just like that.
There's something about Mary.
He was masturbating.
He was masturbating.
That fucking movie.
So God damn funny.
Uh,
shit.
Uh,
gee,
I know you want to,
uh,
address the,
address the crowd here.
Yeah.
So I got two things.
Uh,
first,
I just want to thank everyone for,
for all the love and support this past week.
Uh,
I think the coolest part of uh
people you know reaching out was people commenting on alana's posts saying chicklets nation is behind
you and just like seeing those like i i would get emotional every night just like reading it like
these random people they don't know me they don't know alana just commenting on her tiktok showing
her support just because they listen to this podcast. So I really can't thank everyone enough. We have
the best fans ever. They made me and my family feel super, super loved and supported this past
week. So I can't thank them enough for that. In terms of fundraising, we have some cool ideas in
the works. So stay tuned on that. And lastly, some big, big news here. We will be broadcasting the 50th annual NYPD FDNY broadcast.
We're back, baby.
We're back at UBS.
Biz, Wit, Jake Marsh on the call.
R.A., Colby, Murrows, they'll all be there.
It's going to be an amazing time.
April 20th.
We can't wait to get going.
Dude, that game last year was nuts.
Insane.
It was nuts.
So Brian Yandel
plays games
for the Boston
Police Department.
They played New York
the other day.
He said he walked in,
he's on the phone
and they're all foam rolling,
doing fucking warmups.
So,
they're already like,
buddy,
and they were out there
dumping it in
and hitting guys
and what's the kid's name?
Well,
who's their stud?
Jimmy,
Dan O'Donohue.
O'Donohue.
O'Donohue.
Dan.
Yeah, he was lighting it up.
He was lighting it up out there.
So they're getting ready.
I mean, buddy, they're huge underdogs again.
You know, we saw the firepower from the firepower.
I can't wait to do that game again.
That was one of the most fun things we've ever done on this pod.
But I actually had a... Fuck, dude.
I'm so mad.
I don't know where...
Buddy.
So somebody DM me.
Hey, the Oshawa Fire Department is the top hockey team in North America currently.
Two years they haven't lost a game.
They need a challenge.
They're crushing teams like New York Fire and Toronto Fire easily.
So apparently the Oshawa Fire department are the big dogs right now i'd be interested to talk to the new york guys
who lost to them apparently when we're doing the game well it's actually university of brunt new
brunswick they just act as both teams they're just a wagon they need they need to get as many games
as they can um hey we could we should kind of do this Canadian entity games,
like the university and then get the fire department
versus the American.
We should do that.
We could throw a huge fire and police party
and invitation only.
We find out the top teams, the top 24 teams in North America
fire and police and bring them in and we announce them,
this would be pretty sick, actually.
Along with, of course,
University of New Brunswick
and whoever wins the national championship.
We almost got it.
We'll do it at Boston Garden with no goal judges.
How about that?
Yeah, is this the longest we've gone between roadies?
I feel like two months.
That seems like a long time.
So actually, Biz and I will be,
yeah, it is.
Biz and I will be in Chicago. Biz is. Biz and I will be in Chicago.
Biz is flying Wednesday night.
I'm flying Thursday.
We're going to be there for Thursday, Friday,
March Madness streaming.
And then I'll be out in Scottsdale for IceCon.
IceCon.
Our man Elio, dude, he's a master.
But it's been a tough goal.
And while guys like Dave Portnoy are chirping him online,
like I have his back, I'm standing with him.
So this Dallas Stars-Arizona Coyotes game this upcoming Sunday
with 200 people from Ice Maniacs, the Ice people,
we need that game to go over.
So we'll be there for that in support of our guy, Mr. Ice.
And if you're in the local area around Scottsdale, TPC,
we're going to go to that DraftKings.
They have a cool bar where you can watch live games,
and it's like a whole fantasy factory for gamblers.
So we're going to be there before the game.
So come over there.
The people who bought the original tickets through Elio
have bus transportation.
I think that there are still about 400 or 500 tickets available to the Coyotes game.
So come on by.
Go buy tickets and we'll see you there.
And come on by the DraftKings house there, gambling house.
And then get your own transportation over afterwards so we can meet you there.
We'll post more details on our channel, so look out for that.
And, G gee what was
the other thing that you you mentioned that we needed to do before dny pdf dny yes it's actually
the first day it's on saturday april 20th or 22nd 21st 20th 20th 20th oh i'm with biz on 420
but a so it's the first day of NHL playoffs.
They actually have games and so does TNT.
So I still have to ask for the day off.
What's silly is they have us do the first game this year.
Normally we haven't done it.
So our next broadcast is not till Thursday.
We start on Saturday and our game too. So I'm going to have to take that broadcast off on Saturday, April 20th
because I can't miss this NYPD-FDNY hockey game. And hopefully my bosses at TNT will allow me to miss the opener. And fuck, who the fuck wants to see me on there anyway? You got Wayne, Hank, Ace, and Liam. They can handle the duties and we can get off to the NYPD-FDNY game. So just get ahead of that one.

Raya account in no time, R.A. You can get liquor cheap, but how much is your love?
They say a drunken speech is just so good I like to poke the bear like a stud pie
But then you come on in and take it up a notch
You hit me with a cheap shot, a cheap shot
She hit me with a cheap shot, a cheap shot
I said she needs a detox to cleanse her mind Another week rolls in
We're on the road again
Thought I was safe and sound
In my minivan
But I said something
That crossed the line
And I know she felt it
Someone said she could have a free one on the chain
She went below the bell, shit
She had me with a cheap shot, a cheap shot
She had me with a cheap shot, a cheap shot
I think we need a deep talk You've been so on time Thank you.
