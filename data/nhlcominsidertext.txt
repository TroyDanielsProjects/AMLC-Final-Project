TORONTO -- The 270-mile trip from Toronto to Ottawa is a simple, four-hour journey through the guts of southern Ontario, one that takes you east along the shore of Lake Ontario before veering north through farmland to the capital of Canada.
The trip, weather permitting, is usually pleasant.
Unlike the relationship between these cities and their beloved NHL teams.
Toronto, Canadaâs largest city with its glitzy skyscrapers, is like an older sibling, carrying a sliver of perceived aloofness and entitlement.
Ottawa, home to the Parliament of Canada, is like the younger brother, tired of seemingly being overlooked and not receiving the respect it feels is due.
This tale of two cities is reflected by their respective hockey teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Ottawa Senators. Both the teams and their fans donât like each other.
With the teams poised to face each other in the postseason for the first time in more than two decades, that hasnât changed. Just ask Maple Leafs goalie Anthony Stolarz.
âGoing to be a little bit of a war,â he said. âSo weâll be ready.â
That about says it all.
Welcome to the Battle of Ontario, where history shows the wild, the weird and the wacky can bust out at any time on the ice, in the stands or outside the arena, all woven together with the common thread of animosity.
âThe hate for the Leafs, well, it took years to get over it,â RDS broadcaster Patrick Lalime, who experienced the Battle of Ontario as a goalie with the Senators from 1999-2004, told NHL.com. âWhen you put on that Ottawa jersey, you just donât like Toronto. And you certainly donât like their fans, especially when they try to take over your building.
âEven now, you feel it.â

From an Ottawa perspective, that has always been an issue dating back to the first postseason matchup between the two franchises in 2000. At that time, radio spots on one of the local stations, acknowledging the number of Toronto fans that would jam into the Senatorsâ arena whenever the Maple Leafs visited, urged fans to âLeave your blue and white at home. You live in Ottawa. Not Toronto.â
Daniel Alfredsson, now an assistant with the Senators, was their captain at the time and remembers telling the media before one of Ottawaâs home games in that series that âwe have to score first to take the crowd out of the game.â
That series kicked off a span in which the Maple Leafs and Senators met in the playoffs four times in five years (2000-2004). The fact that Toronto won all four series, with its supporters invading Ottawa in each of them, only irked Senators fans even more.
To that end, in March of 2004, the Ottawa City Council voted unanimously in favor of banning Maple Leafs jerseys from the arena, known then as Corel Centre.
âThe Senators have been an integral part of the economy in Ottawa, and our civic branding, and it's offensive to [have] a bunch of people walking around with Toronto Maple Leaf jerseys when civic pride is on the line,â Councillor Rick Chiarelli said at the time.
In the end, Toronto jerseys were allowed in the building, but those wearing them were encouraged to donate to the local food bank.
Twenty-one years later, Senators owner Michael Andlauer, who has done an outstanding job reviving the franchise and its relationship with the community, is confident that his team will have much better support for home games in the upcoming Eastern Conference First Round series, which starts in Toronto on Sunday (7 p.m. ET; CBC, TVAS, SN, ESPN2).
Single-game tickets for the Senatorsâ home games went on sale Thursday. Prior to that, each Ottawa season ticket holder was allowed to purchase two additional seats. As such, Andlauer said he doesnât expect to see much blue in the stands when the series shifts to Canadian Tire Centre for Games 3 and 4.
âFrankly, our players donât like to have all these (enemy) fans in the building, and I donât like it,â Andlauer said this week. âWith more season tickets, we will outnumber those fans and drown out the noise.â
Andlauer gleefully pointed out an incident from the 2023-24 season that ignited a mass exodus of Toronto fans from Ottawaâs rink.
On Feb. 10, 2024, the host Senators were leading the visiting Maple Leafs 4-3 when Ottawa forward Ridly Greig put an exclamation mark on the win by drilling a slap shot into an empty net with the Toronto goalie pulled for a sixth attacker in the gameâs final seconds. Maple Leafs defenseman Morgan Rielly took exception and cross-checked Greig in the head and was given a five-game suspension.
âYou know that was my favorite play of the year, right?â Andlauer said. âI addressed the players at the end of the year and I told them that. It was more of a statement too, because we had so many Leafs fans in our building. It was more a statement to Leaf fans than it was a statement to the team.
âI think Ridly was so happy.â
At the time, Rielly wasnât. More than a year later, however, heâs taking the high road on the whole thing, although he admits emotions will be high.
âI think itâs just kind of natural intensity just because itâs the playoffs,â he said. âThereâs more at stake.â
Maple Leafs forward Max Domi was more graphic with his comments about the upcoming series. His dad, Tie Domi, played in the four previous Battle of Ontario playoff series as a forward with Toronto.
âItâs going to be an absolute war,â Max said.

Ask Maple Leafs forward John Tavares about his lasting memories of the previous Battle of Ontario playoff matchups, and one moment comes to mind.
ââCujoâ taking out the referee,â he said with a smile.
Tavares was referring to an incident in Game 3 of the 2000 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals.
Ottawa forward Rob Zamuner had just scored to put the Senators up 4-2, and Maple Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph -- nicknamed Cujo -- bolted after referee Mick McGeough, feeling heâd been interfered with on the play. To the shock of all in attendance, Joseph lost his balance and took out the official.
Tavares, who at the time was a 9-year-old growing up in Oakville, Ontario, 30 miles west of Toronto, recalls the play to this day. So, too, does Joseph.
When it comes to the Battle of Ontario, Joseph said, expect anything.
âItâs so great that the rivalry is going to be revived,â Joseph told NHL.com. âWe lived and died in those series. There are so many great memories.â
The McGeough incident is one of the exceptions. At least for him.
âI thought I was interfered with,â he said. âI mean, I didnât like the horn in that arena, I didnât like their team. And I didnât play that well in that game. We didn't play well as a team also. So you know that your frustration boils over. It was extreme, but I just wanted to get to him and argue the point before he got to the penalty box, hoping he'd change his mind, which you know, was not going to happen. It was 4-2 for them, I think, at that point.
âBut if you see the replay, Iâm clearly inside the net. I slipped. The outer edge of my skate probably had lost it from hitting the goal post. You never cross over, really, during the course of the game. Youâre usually on your inside edge. I went to the outside of my right foot and slipped.â
Joseph, who received a 10-minute misconduct, had a subsequent call from the NHL but did not receive any disciplinary punishment, much to the chagrin of the Senators and their fans.
âThe mayor of Ottawa at the time, I forget his name, I remember he wanted me suspended,â Joseph recalled.
He wasnât the only one, as Joseph found out the following morning. At 5 a.m., he was woken up by someone from an Ottawa radio station standing across the street from the Maple Leafsâ hotel, yelling through a bullhorn about the alleged atrocity Joseph had committed against McGeough.
âI was being told, âLeave the referees alone, Cujo!â They were really giving it to me,â he said. âI had to go downstairs and change rooms. They put me on the other side of the building, but I was already up.
âIt was terrible.â
Others also felt the wrath of the fine citizens of Ottawa during the Battles of Ontario of that era.
Maple Leafs forward Darcy Tucker was one of the top pests in the NHL at that time. During a regular-season game in Ottawa on March 4, 2003, then-Maple Leafs forward Travis Green, who was upset at an earlier check heâd been the recipient of, pointed at Senators pugilist Chris Neil sitting on the Ottawa bench (the same bench Green, now the Senators coach, today calls home).
Tucker immediately raced over and began throwing punches at Neil and others on the Ottawa bench. He would be suspended for five games.
Ottawa radio responded by playing an edited song to the tune of Blink-182âs âAll the Small Things.â The lyrics had been altered to reflect the cityâs feelings regarding Tucker in profane fashion.
Just another chapter in a rivalry filled with heroes and villains.
For his part, Tucker said he still gets stopped by people who remember those series to this day.
âJust the memories for them,â he said Thursday. âA lot of kids that were going to university at that time across Ontario, across Canada that were watching in their dorms or watching it at their local pub in town, and they're grown adults now. Some of them are doctors, some of them are lawyers and things of that nature. And to have that core memory for them, I think is pretty special. And I think it comes from both sides -- both kids that were fans of Ottawa and kids that were fans of Toronto."
Tucker rejected the notion that those series were nasty.
âI don't know if it was that nasty, to be honest with you -- nasty for maybe the game today,â he said. âI don't think at that particular point it was overly that bad. There was obviously intensity and pride and things of that nature, and wanting to win.
âBut I don't think it was overly that nasty. I think was just pretty intense.â
Which is a trait the upcoming Battle of Ontario is expected to have.

It was the final Saturday of the 2024-25 regular season, and Lalime, a broadcaster who covers the Montreal Canadiens, was sitting in the Scotiabank Arena seats in Toronto watching highly touted Canadiens prospect Ivan Demidov participate in the optional morning skate.
Suddenly he pointed at the crease in the west end of the arena and chuckled, partially in jest, partially in agony.
âRight there is where I became the mayor of Toronto,â he said sarcastically.
The last time the Maple Leafs and Senators faced each other in the playoffs was Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals on April 20, 2004. Toronto won the game 4-1, thanks in part to two first-period goals from forward Joe Nieuwendyk that squeezed through the five-hole of Lalime. To this day Lalime, who was pulled for the start of the second period with Toronto up 3-0, knows he should have stopped both.
âYou ask yourself what you could have done differently,â he said. âIt took years to get over it. You want to do so well for your teammates. Time helps. But you donât completely forget, especially since it came against the Maple Leafs, the team we wanted to beat so bad.â
For many, the two Nieuwendyk goals he gave up have made Lalime a part of Battle of Ontario lore, which he understands.
âThat comes hand in hand with this rivalry,â he said. âAnd thatâs why itâs great that theyâre playing again in the playoffs 21 years later. Itâs emotional. Itâs intense. Itâs competitive.
âItâs the Battle of Ontario. Itâs supposed to be all those things.â
Chances are, itâs about to be all those things again.

CHICAGO -- Connor Bedard addressed rumors Thursday he isnât happy playing for the Chicago Blackhawks.
âIâm a pretty mild-mannered guy and if I looked a little sad on the bench or something, maybe people can take it out of context,â Bedard said during the Blackhawksâ final media session of the season. âIâve said it so many times, I love being here and the city, the people.
âIf you get the first overall pick, youâre probably not winning the (Stanley) Cup the next two years. It's an understanding of where youâre at. Youâre going out there to win every game but at the end, you know weâre in a process of growing and learning, and thatâs an exciting time. When you lose, it makes winning a lot sweeter once you get there. So, weâre excited for that.â
The No. 1 pick by Chicago at the 2023 NHL Draft, Bedard led the team with 67 points (23 goals, 44 assists) this season. The 19-year-old was coming off a season in which he had 61 points (22 goals, 39 assists) in 2023-24 and won the Calder Trophy, awarded annually to the NHLâs top rookie.
This season had its frustrating moments for Bedard, whether it was an individual scoring slump or two, or the Blackhawksâ overall performance. Chicago (25-46-11) finished last in the Central Division for the second consecutive season and also had a coaching change; Luke Richardson was fired Dec. 5 and replaced by interim coach Anders Sorensen, who was coaching Rockford of the American Hockey League.
âEarly in the year, when youâre losing, guys are frustrated,â Bedard said. âBut weâre just competitive and you want to win. Iâm always having fun at the rink and enjoying the game and stuff. I think things can maybe get taken out of context a little bit. Weâre always happy to be here and playing and having fun and with the young guys coming up, I think there was so much positivity surrounded by it, especially at the end of the year and how many guys made their debuts or came up after they were in Rockford for a bit, or whatever.â
But there are reasons for optimism in Chicago. The emergence of young players such as forwards Frank Nazar, 21, and Oliver Moore, 20, and defensemen Sam Rinzel, 20 and Artyom Levshunov, 19 was encouraging. Levshunov was the No. 2 pick at the 2024 NHL Draft; he had six assists in 18 games.
The Blackhawks finished 4-2-2 in April, including road victories at the Montreal Canadiens and Ottawa Senators on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
âYeah, it was great to see a lot of guysâ growth and see what the future can hold,â Bedard said. âIt was a lot of fun to get to play with these guys. It was kind of growing up with these guys and keep improving.â
Bedard is eligible to sign his next contract with the Blackhawks on July 1. He just finished the second of a three-year, $2.85 million entry-level deal ($950,000 average annual value) he signed July 17, 2023.
General manager Kyle Davidson said, âWeâll see if thereâs anything to announce this summerâ regarding another contract for Bedard, but heâs happy with the centerâs growth in several areas.
âI think some more of the nuances of the game, the things that weâll lean on him (for) as someone who is going to play a lot of minutes and important minutes. You know -- your face-offs, some of the defensive aspects of the game,â Davidson said.
âAgain, know heâs 19, heâs got room and areas to grow in. I believe he truly understands that; heâs excited to attack that. But no, I think some more of those nuanced parts of the game, I think we saw some nice progress from him. Iâm sure heâd like his production to be higher and all that. For his point in his career, heâs done an incredible job of not only handling the on-ice but the off-ice and also producing and playing some good hockey while still only 19 years of age.â
Bedard said heâs not sure yet if heâll play for Canada in the IIHF World Championship, which will be May 9-25 in Sweden and Denmark.
âI think thatâs something that will come out pretty soon,â Bedard said. âStill kind of deciding on that, but weâll see here in the next few days.â
Whether he competes in the tournament or not, Bedard said heâll spend most of his summer at home in North Vancouver, British Columbia, preparing for next season. Heâll be working on his overall game, with a focus on trying to improve his speed and acceleration.
The Blackhawks are optimistic in the trajectory theyâre taking, and Bedard is happy to be in Chicago.
âEven before I got drafted, I was embraced as one of (Chicagoâs) own, so itâs a special sports town and we have a lot of great players coming up, great people,â Bedard said. âAnything can get said. I donât really look at that, donât really see a lot of that unless someone shows me. But I just think people who know me know I love to be here and really trust the direction weâre going.â

BOSTON -- It all started the morning of Feb. 16, when the United States team for the 4 Nations Face-Off finally made it to Boston from Montreal through a major snowstorm. They sat on the runway for what felt like forever, had gotten in around 6 a.m.
Charlie McAvoy, meanwhile, was not feeling good. That whole Sunday, his shoulder kept getting worse and worse, the pain increasing by the hour.
âThat night, we were staying at the Ritz downtown, I didnât sleep the whole night, because I was just in so much pain,â the Boston Bruins defenseman said. âI knew the next day we played Sweden and I wasnât playing, they were like, âGive it time.â The final was on Thursday, which seemed like an eternity, like, get healthy.
âThe next day was when stuff really flew off the rails.â
He had sustained an injury to his right shoulder acromioclavicular (AC) joint in a game against Finland on Feb. 13, underwent treatment and played against Canada two days later. But the pain wasnât presenting like the AC joint injury, with a marked redness creeping up his shoulder. It was confusing doctors and leaving McAvoy in tremendous pain.
He went to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he underwent X-rays, MRIs and bloodwork and was diagnosed with an infection, necessitating an irrigation and debridement Feb. 18.
McAvoy did not play again this season.
âI feel a lot about it, every emotion you can have,â McAvoy said Thursday at the Bruinsâ end-of-season media availability. âIâm not angry at any one individual. Iâm angry at what happened. Iâm sad about what happened. A little bit of the âWhy me?â as Iâm sure anyone would ask with what happened. So, itâs a lot of different emotions.
âIt cost me my season. It cost my season, it cost me a lot. Iâve spent a lot of time emotionally just sitting with it because that was the reality of it. Iâm sitting at home, with a PICC [peripherally inserted central catheter] line and this and that and I canât play and I canât help my team.â
He had contracted a rare staph infection, though no one -- including the head of infectious disease at Massachusetts General Hospital -- is quite sure exactly how it was introduced. There was the injection to try to numb the area, a common procedure. Then came the infection.
âWhat happened to me was simply bad luck,â McAvoy said. âThereâs always a risk of that happening, but you donât ever hear about it. And it happened to me. So, you want to talk about a perfect storm, the why me and how did this happen? Like, thereâs not necessarily that anyone did anything wrong; I just happened to have an infection that took place.â
It could have, as he said, been his Under Armour, a pillow at the hotel, his gear.
Itâs impossible to know.
âWe could speculate all day -- and trust me, I have,â McAvoy said. âYou think I donât want to blame somebody for this? So, Iâve spent that time and Iâve shed those tears on that.
âThe reality is thereâs no one to blame. Itâs just bad luck that this happened.â
It was an abrupt end to a season that started with so much promise but ended with the Bruins (33-39-10) finishing last in the Eastern Conference and out of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time since 2016.
âI donât even feel like I played hockey this year,â he said. âWhich is so unfortunate because I think I played more games than I might have even thought, but I havenât played since February. At times itâs felt like that was last season or something separate in my head because itâs felt like itâs been so long.
âYouâre running a race and you donât get to cross the finish line.â
McAvoy only came off antibiotics last week, more than two months after the initial injury. The repair of the injury, he estimated, should take about three months. He still isnât cleared to play but was getting close.
He said had Boston been in position to make the playoffs or been in the running down the stretch, it would have been a conversation with management and doctors about trying to clear him. He had been preparing to come back and play this season, with McAvoy saying that acting that way âgave me purpose, gave me a reason to get out of bed, like it wasnât that dramatic, but to come to the rink and behave like I still had a reason.â
That didnât end up mattering.
But the good news is the injury to the AC joint will not hinder McAvoy in the future, will not be something he has to manage.
âI have no restrictions this summer, I have no limitations on anything, which allows me to have a big summer, which Iâm really excited about,â he said.
What happened is not something that will impact McAvoyâs desire to play in future international events, especially the 2026 Milano-Cortina Olympics, which he called âmy dream of dreams.â
Even playing in the game against Canada on Feb. 15, after the injury, was part of that.
âItâs the aftermath of that that it cost me my year,â he said. âThereâs a lot of -- I donât want to say regret -- but an acceptance of what happened and it [stinks] and Iâm still coming to grips with it. But I wouldnât trade it. The experience I wouldnât trade, the friendships, all of that. Thatâs what you dream of.â
Still, it made a difficult season even more difficult. He was unable to return to help the Bruins while they sank deeper in the standings, eventually selling off assets at the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7 and finishing last in the East.
âYouâre watching your friends, your teammates struggle. Youâre trying to be there to help with that, [but] you canât,â McAvoy said. âSo many things this year were just unfortunate, so thereâs frustration. Thereâs certainly motivation to never be here again, to find ways for us to improve this culture, to get back to what it looked like because this isnât a good place to be right now.â
This will be the longest summer of McAvoyâs career, after he made his NHL debut in the 2017 playoffs and he and the Bruins have played in every postseason since. Itâs the silver lining heâs taking from all thatâs happened.
Itâs not just his health that heâs looking to recover this offseason, though; itâs also the team heâs known and been a part of his whole career. Itâs a team that, at the start of the season, he said was ready to win, to take the next step with a core that has since scattered throughout the NHL: Brad Marchand in Florida with the Panthers, Brandon Carlo in Toronto with the Maple Leafs, Charlie Coyle in Colorado with the Avalanche, Trent Frederic in Edmonton with the Oilers.
âThat starts very quickly after this,â he said. âGetting together and establishing what we want, what our pillars are going to look like, what we want the culture to get back to and how weâre going to do it.
âWhat an opportunity. What an exciting challenge that thatâs going to be for us. Not just us, but a few other guys. Weâre going to take it head on. Weâre going to do everything that we can. You canât do it by yourself, weâre going to do it together, but weâre really excited about the opportunity and the challenge, what it presents and how we can be a part of the solution.â
Because this? This isnât what heâs come to expect from the Bruins.
âTo not feel like this again,â McAvoy said of what he wants. âNever been here, I donât want to be here again.â

Jack Eichel has experienced health issues throughout his NHL career. The Vegas Golden Knights center has missed weeks, sometimes months with various injuries, from the herniated disk that required artificial disk replacement surgery in 2021 to a lower-body injury that led to surgery last season.
But good health has been on his side this season.
âWeâve had a good season as a team and Iâve been a benefactor of a lot of those things, but for myself personally, yeah, this is probably the best Iâve felt physically and mentally in quite some time,â Eichel said. âSo, itâs been good.â
Eichel had an NHL career-high 94 points (28 goals, 66 assists) in 77 games, the most he played in a regular season since playing 77 for the Buffalo Sabres in 2018-19.
And now he's ready for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the Golden Knights (50-22-10), who won the Pacific Division and will play the Minnesota Wild (45-30-7), the first wild card, in the Western Conference First Round.
Game 1 of the best-of-7 series is at T-Mobile Arena on Sunday (10 p.m. ET; ESPN, SN, SN360, TVAS).
Eichel was by far the Golden Knightsâ top scorer this season; forward Mark Stone was second with 67 points (19 goals, 48 assists) in 66 games.
The 28-year-old also led Vegas with 34 power-play points and averaged 20:32 of ice time per game, most among its forwards and fourth on the team behind defensemen Alex Pietrangelo (22:24), Shea Theodore (22:00) and Noah Hanifin (21:33).

Eichel was also plus-32, which led Golden Knights forwards.
âWhen heâs been healthy, heâs played very well both ends of the ice; heâs a little more confident,â coach Bruce Cassidy said. âYou win a (Stanley) Cup, thatâs going to do that for you. He had a good playoff run (in 2022), so you have a little swagger in a good way.
ââ¦ I think his bodyâs cooperating with him and heâs been able to go out there every night. Different linemates. Mark Stone missed a lot of time; he was with him. (Ivan) Barbashev missed a lot of time. So, heâs elevated other peopleâs games around him. Heâs probably played with every winger in that room, and it hasnât affected him at all in a negative. Itâs always been a positive.â
Eichel had 26 points (six goals, 20 assists) in 22 playoff games in 2023, helping Vegas win the Stanley Cup for the first time.
Don Granato worked with Eichel for the United States National Team Development Program and then with the Sabres, mainly as an assistant coach from 2019-21. He believes Eichelâs health -- but more importantly his evolution since being selected by Buffalo with the No. 2 pick in the 2015 NHL Draft -- has helped him continue to produce.
âHeâs pouncing on situations with more clarity than, âOK, my skillset can take advantage of this situation as it arises.â Thatâs just maturity, which every single player realizes that,â Granato said. â(Washington Capitals captain Alex) Ovechkinâs realizing that in a different way because his body canât do what it did in his 20s. He realizes, âI can score this way, add to my game that way.â They all evolve their game.â

Eichel was drafted immediately after Connor McDavid was taken No. 1 by the Edmonton Oilers. He made his NHL debut at the age of 18 and was tasked with helping reverse the Sabresâ fortunes.
Buffalo (35-39-7) hasnât qualified for the postseason since 2010-11.
âItâs not easy to be in the same draft as McDavid, not easy to be identified at 14, 15 years old to be a budding star,â Granato said. âThereâs a lot of baggage that comes with that, a lot of extra drama, questions, and it can be a very large weight, as you see with all high-end kids. They bear an extra burden. They donât ask for it, they just want to play hockey. He has a love of his team and teammates and just wants to come to the rink and play hockey. Itâs nice to see him enjoying that more and more as he goes through his career.â
Ralph Krueger, who coached Eichel with the Sabres from 2019-21, said Eichel needed to bide his time.
âHe wanted so much, so fast in his career that I think (it was) just patience for the way things come at you during a season and accepting also tougher times or little setbacks with the team or with himself and not putting quite so much pressure on himself all the time to be the one,â Krueger said. âThe way it was in Buffalo, it was hard for him not to be, because he had the âCâ and all those other things at such a young age.â
When Eichel was traded to the Golden Knights on Nov. 4, 2021, he joined a team that was still relatively new to the NHL (their inaugural season was 2017-18) but was one of the best in the League. Vegas advanced to the Stanley Cup Final that first season and has qualified for the playoffs in seven of eight.
âContinuing to watch him in Vegas with the Cup, a little bit of an injury-prone season and this year coming into a real consistent version, best version of himself and just dominating to lead his team to another first-place finish, itâs nothing but a pleasure,â Krueger said. âAs someone who coached for three decades, heâs one of those highlights where youâre engaged when youâre with him and you continue to cheer him as he moves on. Itâs a real pleasure.
âIâm not surprised by anything Iâve seen since heâs been in Vegas. It was all within him and he just needed to continue to put the package together consistently.â
This was the first season in which Eichel flirted with having 100 points, but heâs more focused on feeling great entering the playoffs, as are the rest of the Golden Knights. Itâs time to see if they can all enjoy some more postseason success.
âItâs been a while since Iâve been this healthy per se, played this many games,â Eichel said. âWhen you get in that rhythm of playing games and just consistently being out there, it just adds that confidence and your feeling of your ability to play every other night or whatever it is.
âFor me, itâs just trying to stay consistent in what Iâm doing throughout the year and work hard and understand what works for me, what makes me successful.â

EDMONTON -- With the Edmonton Oilers dealing with injuries to several key players down the stretch of the regular season, captain Connor McDavid said it would be a mistake to discount his team's chances in the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
McDavid is confident most of the injured players will return for Game 1 of the Western Conference First Round against the Los Angeles Kings. The playoffs begin Saturday.
âI donât like the theory that people are counting us out,â McDavid said Tuesday. âWeâre a great team here. Weâve had bumps and bruises along the way here, but weâre a dangerous team when weâre rolling and weâre healthy. I think youâll see that over the next little while and weâre looking forward to showing that.â
The Oilers (48-29-5) will finish third in the Pacific Division behind the Kings (48-24-9). After concluding its regular season with a 3-0 win against the San Jose Sharks on Wednesday, Edmonton will begin the playoffs at Los Angeles. Itâs the fourth straight season the teams will face each other in the first round, with the Oilers winning the previous three series.
McDavid had an assist against the Sharks to reach 100 points for the eighth time in 10 NHL seasons -- and the fifth straight season -- and will be ready for Game 1.
The center missed eight games with a lower-body injury sustained in a 4-3 overtime loss to the Winnipeg Jets on March 20. He returned to play three games and had nine assists before sitting out Monday for precautionary reasons in the second game of a back-to-back and Edmontonâs third game in four days.
âIâve felt, personally, night and day better from before the injury just in terms of rest,â McDavid said. âNot getting a break for the 4 Nations (Face-Off, in February), which Iâm not complaining about at all, I feel night and day better since the injury.â
McDavid has 100 points (26 goals, 74 assists) in 67 games. He missed three games after sustaining an ankle injury at the Columbus Blue Jackets on Oct. 28 and was suspended for three for cross-checking Vancouver Canucks forward Conor Garland on Jan. 18.

Forwards Leon Draisaitl (lower body), Zach Hyman (undisclosed) and Trent Frederic (ankle), and defensemen Mattias Ekholm (lower body), Jake Walman (undisclosed) and Troy Stecher (undisclosed) did not play against the Kings or Sharks. Draisaitl missed four games with an undisclosed injury from March 20-27, returned for three games and was injured again in a 3-2 win at San Jose on April 3. He missed his eighth straight game Wednesday.
Draisaitl leads the NHL with 52 goals and is tied with Boston Bruins forward David Pastrnak for third with 106 points (54 assists) in 71 games.
âI feel Leon is going to feel the same way [as me],â McDavid said. âEverybody is going to feel the same way coming out of that, and weâll be ready to roll.â
The Oilers will enter the playoffs looking to return to the Stanley Cup Final, where they lost 2-1 in Game 7 to the Florida Panthers last season. Theyâve been fortunate to avoid too many injuries the past few seasons, but that luck seems to have run out.
Evander Kane has been out all season after the forward had surgery to repair a sports hernia and a knee injury, but he could be ready to rejoin the Oilers in the playoffs. Frederic was acquired from the Boston Bruins in a three-team trade also involving the New Jersey Devils on March 6. He made his Edmonton debut at Los Angeles on April 5 but was limited to 7:10 of ice time before reaggravating a high ankle sprain. The Oilers do not expect him to be available for Game 1 against the Kings.
Edmonton has not played with a full, healthy lineup since March 4.
âItâs been unique, kind of unprecedented for our group,â McDavid said. âWeâve had a great string of health for a long time, and I saw [coach Kris Knoblauch] allude to it, everything has hit us at once. It is true; guys are healthier than it may seem. I think guys have kind of this aura about us that weâre the walking wounded, but weâre just fine.
âEverybody is going to be ready to roll, everybody is doing whatever they can to be back.â
Ekholm is one player not expected back in the first round. He has been dealing with his injury since returning from the 4 Nations Face-Off. Ekholm had missed 13 of 17 games since March 4 before returning against San Jose on April 11, when he left after three shifts. He was ruled out of the first round by Knoblauch on Monday.
âI wish I could spin that one for you, but itâs obviously disappointing,â McDavid said. âThereâs no way around that. Obviously, weâll miss him for a little bit. But that being said, heâs going to do everything he can to get healthy whenever that may be. Heâs a great player, does everything right, maybe the best all-around defenseman there is. Heâs a big loss, obviously.
ââ¦ Would it have been nice to get some games with a full lineup? Sure, but thatâs not the case weâre dealing with. But everybody is ready to roll, everyone is doing everything they can possible and not everything is as it seems.â

Transitioning to a different NHL team can take time. There are new teammates, new systems, new surroundings. But for Martin Necas, the adjustment to the Colorado Avalanche seemed to go pretty quick.
âI mean, itâs a puck-possession team so it definitely works for me,â Necas said. âIâm enjoying it and just trying to build a chemistry and be as good as possible for the playoffs.â
Necasâ NHL home changed on Jan. 24 when he was sent to the Avalanche by the Carolina Hurricanes in the blockbuster trade that saw forward Mikko Rantanen go the other way.
In his 30 games with the Avalanche, Necas had 28 points (11 goals, 17 assists). And now itâs time for the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, with the Avalanche (49-29-4) set to play the Dallas Stars and Rantanen, who was traded there from Carolina on March 7. Game 1 of the best-of-7 series is at Dallas on Saturday (8:30 p.m. ET; Victory+, MAX, truTV, TNT, ALT, SN360, SN, TVAS).
Necas has plenty of postseason experience, with 30 points (11 goals, 19 assists) in 59 playoff games. His career high was nine points (four goals, five assists) in 11 games with Carolina last postseason.
Asked if he looked back at what worked or didnât work for Necas in the playoffs or if he just starts with a fresh plate with Colorado, Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said, âfresh plate, but I know what worked for him already and what doesnât.â
âItâs the same thing that works for him and what doesnât in the regular season,â he said. âWeâve had some discussions on his play and what he needs to do, because I think he can be a huge X-factor in this series.â
The No. 12 pick by the Hurricanes in the 2017 NHL Draft, Necas has 326 points (124 goals, 202 assists) in 441 career games with Carolina and Colorado. He had 55 points (16 goals, 39 assists) in 49 games with the Hurricanes this season prior to the trade.
The 26-year-old wasted no time in adjusting, getting five points (one goal, four assists) in his first four games and nine points (four goals, five assists) through his first eight games with Colorado.

âOur game stylistically fits the way he likes to play and wants to play, and I also think he had stretches like that in Carolina tooâ Bednar said. âThis is a player coming into his own and maturing into an elite player in the League.
âObviously, heâs gained a lot of confidence over the years. Heâs learned to play the right way in Carolina. I think itâs a good fit with some of our personnel, the way we like to play, and heâs excited to be here, so that always helps.â
Perhaps the tradeâs timing helped Necasâ transition time too. He came to Colorado in January, well ahead of the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7.
âThat was definitely nice,â Necas said. âAfter the (4 Nations Face-Off) break (in February) we were all moved in in Denver and settled down. So, that was good. It was definitely easier.â
Necas isnât as prolific a scorer as Rantanen, who had 100 points or more in two straight seasons with the Avalanche (105 in 2022-23, 104 in 2023-24). But he was a steady producer with Carolina (his career high was 71 points in 2022-23), and thatâs continued in Colorado, where heâs averaging 0.93 points per game since the trade.
âI think weâve seen him just scratch the surface,â Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson said. âI just think he has another level, maybe not only offensively but on the defensive side of the puck too. I think he is learning that part of the game from our guys and Jared.
âWeâre a team thatâs really explosive offensively but also really good on the defensive side of the puck, too, and heâs learning that. Heâs got more from his defensive game thatâs only going to get better, and I think heâll see his offense go up, too, spending less time in the defensive zone.â
Necas learned a lot about defense in Carolina with coach Rod BrindâAmour. Chicago Blackhawks forward Teuvo Teravainen, Necasâ teammate in Carolina from 2017-24, said it took Necas some time to develop his two-way game.
âThereâs always been the skill and the speed, but especially in Carolina the systems and the team game was a big part of it." Teravainen said "Whenever we played good, everybody was doing that. Iâm sure âRoddyâ was all over him with that part, too. Same with me. I got a lot better as the years went by with the two-way game. I donât know how you say it, but when you have so much skill, so much speed and then how are you going to use it? You have to find the balance. You canât just be flying around and just doing all the skill stuff.
âSometimes you just have to play a simple game and the skill comes after. Iâve seen him learn that, for sure.â
When Necas first joined the Avalanche, he played right wing on the top line with center Nathan MacKinnon. But since the Avalanche acquired center Brock Nelson from the New York Islanders on March 6, he's played on his line.

Nelson said itâs nice to play with Necas, not against him.
âThe guy, he can fly, he can wheel, (has) tons of skill,â Nelson said. âDefinitely saw it firsthand playing against him, and I think when you see him in practice and what heâs working on and things heâs able to do [it] is pretty incredible. He has tons of skill, puck-handling and the speed at which he does it.
âTo play with him is nice. He drives guys back, drives defenders back, creates space for himself, creates separation and confusion for the other guys, too. So, you get him the puck and he gets wheeling, you get open, heâs going to be able to find you.â
Despite the postseason experience with Carolina, Necas hasnât come close to winning the Stanley Cup. The furthest the Hurricanes got was the Eastern Conference Final in 2023, but they were swept by the Florida Panthers.
The Avalanche, on the other hand, are vying for the Stanley Cup again after winning it in 2022. Necas is ready to help them do it.

The fans rose to their feet at the end of the Utah Hockey Clubâs final home game, a 4-3 shootout loss to the Nashville Predators at Delta Center on Thursday. As they cheered, the players rose their sticks in salute.
Itâs incredible what Utah has accomplished in a year, and it should only get better from here with a permanent brand identity, a new practice facility, an upgraded arena and an up-and-coming team.
âOur thesis in this endeavor was certainly that we had a great potential hockey market in Utah,â Utah president of hockey operations Chris Armstrong said. âAnd weâve been absolutely blown away, far exceeding our expectations.â
It was almost exactly one year ago when the Arizona Coyotes finished the 2023-24 season with a 5-2 win against the Edmonton Oilers at Mullett Arena on April 17, 2024. Arizona had 77 points in the standings. The arena had a capacity of 4,600.
With no arena solution on the horizon, the NHL established a new franchise in Utah the next day. Utah purchased Arizonaâs hockey assets and scrambled to prepare in about six months. Among the many tasks: creating a temporary brand identity, building a temporary practice facility at Utah Olympic Oval and completing initial renovations of Delta Center, home of the NBAâs Utah Jazz.
Utah finished its inaugural season Tuesday. It had 89 points in the standings and sold out the 11,131 full-view seats for every game at Delta Center. It set arena records for beer and merchandise sales, and it secured so many corporate sponsorships that itâs on track to rank among the top 15 teams in the NHL in overall sponsorship revenue.
The team hosted 10 community events and attracted about 10,000 kids to hockey programs. Owner Ryan Smith said Smith Entertainment Group will donate up to $500,000 per rink for up to 20 new rinks built by entrepreneurs across the state.
âThe response from the community has been incredible,â Armstrong said. âItâs been very energizing and motivating to all of us with everything that weâve needed to do and accomplish to stand up this team and mobilize for our inaugural season. A lot of that fuel came from the passion and support that weâve received in the community.â
Ninety percent of season-ticket holders will renew for next season. Work is already beginning on the next phase of Delta Center renovations, with details to be released soon.
âWeâre not wasting any time there, getting right down to it, and obviously our goal on the hockey side is to continue to bring as many great seats online each summer as we can to ultimately make a world-class NHL venue,â Armstrong said.
The permanent practice facility at The Shops at South Town is scheduled to be ready for the team in time for training camp in September and for the public late in the year. Utah plans to announce the permanent brand identity sometime before next season, but the timing depends on the trademark process.
âThere are obviously some tentpole moments throughout the summer that weâd love to take advantage of, but itâs a painstaking approach to get all of the [intellectual property] protected in the ways that we want so that we can unveil it to the world and celebrate it with our fans,â Armstrong said.
The future is bright on the ice. Among the highlights this season: Forward Clayton Keller, the first captain in Utah history, led the team and set an NHL career high with 90 points (30 goals, 60 assists) in 81 games. Forward Logan Cooley, who turns 21 on May 4, had 65 points (25 goals, 40 assists) in 75 games. Forward Dylan Guenther, who turned 22 on April 10, had 60 points (27 goals, 33 assists) in 70 games.
âFrom the very beginning, we set our expectations really for the young guys in our group to take a step forward in their development and for us to be playing meaningful games down the stretch, which we ended up doing right into the month of April,â Armstrong said. âWeâve had obviously some great standout performances.â
Utah has promising prospects on the way. It also has salary-cap space and extra picks in the NHL Draft, including three second-rounders in 2026, giving management the ability to make moves.
âIt doesnât necessarily mean weâre going to do anything,â Armstrong said. âWhat it means is weâre going to have the good fortune of being in all of those conversations and evaluating whatâs best in the short term and long term for our organization, and thatâs a great place to be.
âTo have that flexibility, to have those resources to truly be able to evaluate everything, is something we wonât take for granted, and youâve still got to make good decisions and get those decisions right. And thatâs the primary focus. We know areas, of course, like every other team, that we think we can improve, and weâre going to look to do that.â

The Calgary Flames failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the third consecutive season.
The Flames (40-27-14) were eliminated from contention prior to a 5-4 shootout win against the Vegas Golden Knights at Scotiabank Saddledome on Tuesday. They needed a win against Vegas and help from either the Anaheim Ducks, who were defeated 3-2 in overtime by the Minnesota Wild, or the Utah Hockey Club, which lost 6-1 to the St. Louis Blues.
Calgary is a team in transition under general manager Craig Conroy, who replaced Brad Treliving on May 23, 2023, and inherited a roster with several expiring contracts that needed to be addressed in his first season. The Flames traded players who were pending unrestricted free agents while staying competitive with a young core bolstered by a handful of key veterans. They're considered a team on the rise and likely exceeded expectations by staying in the playoff hunt for as long as they did.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Flames and why things could be better next season.
The skinny
Potential unrestricted free agents: Anthony Mantha, F; Kevin Rooney, F; Justin Kirkland, F; Dryden Hunt, F; Joel Hanley, D; Tyson Barrie, D; Dan Vladar, G
Potential restricted free agents: Morgan Frost, F; Matt Coronato, F; Connor Zary, F; Adam Klapka, F; Kevin Bahl, D
Potential 2025 Draft picks: 7
What went wrong
Still retooling: Conroy said it would be a retooling season heading into training camp with young players getting an opportunity to compete for ice time. Several exceeded expectations, and although there were times when it looked like the Flames would drop out of the playoff race, they managed to stay alive until the final week. Inexperience proved to be a factor in tight games throughout the season, especially down the stretch.
Scoring issues: Calgary displayed plenty of heart but was unable to convert their work ethic into enough goals. The Flames are 30th in scoring (2.65 goals per game) and their 135 goals at 5-on-5 are tied with the Ottawa Senators for 30th. Though they played well defensively and received solid goaltending from Vladar and Dustin Wolf, they needed to generate more offense as a group to get over the hump and into a playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Special teams struggle: The Flames had difficulty on the power play (19th, 21.2 percent) and penalty kill, which presented an issue too big to overcome. The kill (76.2 percent) is 25th and they've allowed 53 power-play goals (26th). A better power play would have gone a long way considering Calgary has 231 opportunities with the man-advantage (tied for seventh with the Montreal Canadiens and Detroit Red Wings).
Reasons for optimism
Wolf: The 23-year-old had an outstanding rookie season. Wolf was selected in the seventh round (No. 214) of the 2019 NHL Draft. He worked his way up through the American Hockey League, where he was named most valuable player in 2023 and goalie of the year twice (2022, '23). Wolf is 29-16-8 with a 2.64 goals-against average, .910 save percentage and three shutouts in 53 games, and a top candidate for the Calder Trophy awarded to the NHL rookie of the year. He did not look particularly comfortable in 17 games last season (15 starts), going 7-7-1 with a 3.16 GAA and .893 save percentage, so whatever issues he had during his first stint in the NHL were resolved.
Young core: A "retool" gave younger players more of an opportunity than they would have gotten on an older, more experienced team, which will prove valuable next season. Along with Wolf, Calgary received contributions from forwards Coronato, 22, Zary, 23, Klapka. 24, Martin Pospisil, 25, Frost, 25, Joel Farabee, 25, and Yegor Sharangovich, 26; and defensemen Bahl, 24, Brayden Pachal, 25, and Jake Bean, 26. Zayne Parekh, a 19-year-old defenseman selected with the No. 9 pick in the 2024 NHL Draft, was recalled April 8 after he had 107 points (33 goals, 74 assists) in 61 games for Saginaw in the Ontario Hockey League. If the Flames can keep the young group together, they should grow and become more competitive.
Veterans led the way: Jonathan Huberdeau had his best season for the Flames since he was acquired with MacKenzie Weegar in the trade that sent Matthew Tkachuk to the Florida Panthers on July 22, 2022. The 31-year-old forward has 62 points (28 goals, 34 assists) in 81 games, exceeding his production from his first two seasons in Calgary. Though Huberdeau is still a long way from the 115 points (30 goals, 85 assists) he had in 80 games in 2021-22, he's trending in the right direction, which is a positive. Nazem Kadri has scored an NHL career-high 33 goals while leading by example. The 34-year-old is in the third season of a seven-year, $49 million contract ($7 million average annual value) he signed Aug. 18, 2022, and will continue to be a valuable veteran voice to a young team.

When the Sports Emmy Awards recognize excellence in sports television coverage in 2024, nine nominations will be connected to the NHL, including two projects produced by the League itself.
That's the most by far since Steve Mayer joined the NHL in January 2016.
"Think about it," said Mayer, president of NHL content and events. "Every night, there are so many shows on, and it's all narrowed down to five nominees in each category. And we've got nine of those? That's crazy to me. That's where it really is pretty cool. I'm really proud of a lot of people."
The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced the nominees this week. The 46th annual ceremony will be held at Lincoln Center in New York on May 20.
ESPN received seven nominations: Outstanding Edited Special for "No Easy Victories: The 1994 New York Rangers"; Outstanding Open/Tease and Outstanding Editing -- Short Form for "Gloves -- The Story of Phil Pritchard and the Stanley Cup"; Outstanding Digital Innovation for "NHL in ASL"; Outstanding Audio/Sound -- Live Event for "NHL on ESPN"; Outstanding Studio or Production Design/Art Direction for the 2024 NHL Draft; and the George Wensel Technical Achievement Award partly for "NHL Big City Greens Classic."
TNT received two nominations: Outstanding Studio Show -- Limited Run for "NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs on TNT" and Outstanding Audio/Sound -- Live Event for "NHL Winter Classic on TNT."
"We're really proud of what our rightsholders and partners have produced," Mayer said. "They both keep putting out great products, and we're just so happy for them that they were recognized. I'm sure the competition will be tough. You know the night of the show who we're going to be cheering for."
The NHL produced the 2024 NHL Draft, the first live sporting event at Sphere in Las Vegas, and "NHL in ASL," a first-of-its-kind broadcast of the 2024 Stanley Cup Final in American Sign Language.

Sphere, the brainchild of New York Rangers owner James Dolan, is the world's largest spherical building. Inside is the world's highest-resolution LED screen, playing 16K content that wraps up, over and behind the audience. The exterior is wrapped with the world's largest LED screen.
"We knew that we had to show how big this was," Mayer said. "We had to show the grand spectacle of it all. That was the most important piece."
Mayer, NHL group vice president of creative services Paul Conway and NHL senior designer Angel DelValle took the lead in design for the 2024 NHL Draft, then brought in people with the expertise to bring it to life. They created custom content to create an immersive experience for the people in attendance and translated it for the TV audience. The visuals were stunning.
"We really treated the whole thing in a very unique way," Mayer said. "There was a lot -- a lot -- of preparation, a lot of effort. Being the first ones to do a live event in that venue was a challenge, but yet we just felt like we could do it and we could pull it off.

"There were some great moments, and I'm sure when we sent in our submission video, it was probably not very difficult to catch people's eye. It was different, and as many who watched it had said, it was like nothing they had ever seen before. That one we're unbelievably proud of."
The NHL became the first major professional sports league in North America to produce an alternate live game telecast specifically for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
Matt Celli, NHL group vice president and coordinating director/studio manager at NHL Productions, and Rachel Segal, NHL vice president of social impact and strategic integration, led the effort to stream each game of the 2024 Stanley Cup Final in ASL on ESPN+ and Sportsnet+, a first for both networks.
The broadcasters didn't interpret for other broadcasters. They did their own commentary in ASL, signing for about 21 hours over seven games. Graphics visualized sounds, and emojis depicted events like goals, penalties and hits.

"We were just blown away by how the idea took off," Mayer said. "We've always felt like this was so unique and so valuable and meaningful. To be recognized, for a lot of people who put in some spectacular amounts of work, this is just an amazing, amazing accomplishment.
"We've continued to build on what we did last year in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. We're doing them now at outdoor games, special events. We're continually serving the deaf community."
This is a big moment at NHL headquarters in New York.
"This is awesome," Mayer said. "There are a lot of people that share in the nominations. Running a department as large as ours and how it's grown over the years, it's a great feeling -- and you'd be lying if you said otherwise -- when you get nominated. The buzz and the energy go up in the building when you get this news, and there are a lot of people that can and should take credit."

MONTREAL -- There wasnât a whisker on the now-bearded chin of Montreal Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher 12 years ago, but his grin today is exactly what he wore on Jan. 27, 2013, holding the puck with which he scored his first NHL goal.
The smile on Thursday had everything to do with the Canadiens knocking loudly on the door of the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time in four years, and with the pride he feels in the way the team is charging into the final days of the regular season.
Gallagherâs first career goal came at Bell Centre on a 25-foot wrist shot, beating New Jersey Devils legend Martin Brodeur 13:35 into the first period. He has scored 238 goals since that one potted during his third NHL game.
Now heâs chuckling at a photo of himself and then-teammate Brandon Prust in this dressing room, Gallagher gripping the puck of his first NHL goal, the veteran Prust holding his first with the Canadiens following a 4-3 overtime win.

Brendan Gallagher (r.) with the puck he used to score his first NHL goal on Jan. 27, 2013. With him is teammate Brandon Prust, who that night scored his first goal as a member of the Canadiens.

Gallagher has played all 830 of his NHL games with the Canadiens since being chosen by Montreal in the fifth round (No. 147) of the 2010 NHL Draft. For 13 seasons, he has played battered and bruised, black and blue from punishment absorbed for parking his 5-foot-9, 185-pound body in front of the opposing goalie, and from forever rumbling well outside of his weight class.
Gallagher has ridden the highs and lows of hockey in one of the gameâs most passionate markets, skating into the Stanley Cup Playoffs six times during his first 12 seasons.
Now, after missing the postseason the past three seasons, he and Montreal teammates are on the verge of pushing into the playoffs. They can clinch a berth on Friday with a regulation win against the Ottawa Senators on Friday (7 p.m. ET, RDS, SNE, SNO, SNW).
And thereâs that grin again.
He laughs when the question is put to him to guess roughly how many teammates heâs had in Montreal.

âA hundred and fifty?â he ventures, coming up 56 short.
Should the Canadiens still be playing beyond Game 82, the city again will be in the grip of playoff fever, last felt during the teamâs 22-game 2021 playoff run, ending with a five-game Stanley Cup Final loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. With COVID-19 restrictions, Montrealâs early home playoff games were played in a virtually empty Bell Centre, then with crowds of only 2,500 and 3,500; now, 21,105 will pack the arena.
âThis group really had to earn it to get to this point,â Gallagher said after practice on Thursday, the Canadiens packing for their huge road game against the Senators.
The Senators hold the first wild card in the Eastern Conference, three points ahead of the Canadiens. Both teams have played 78 games.

âWe dipped as far down as you can dip, we had some hard days, some hard practice days, but it kind of defined us,â Gallagher said. âWe stuck together as a group, we went through it together. Now weâre starting to reap the rewards a little bit.
âItâs always important to keep in the back of your mind what you went through. Thatâs what makes you who you are. As a group, itâs hopefully what makes us a special group.â
The Canadiens had three particularly difficult stretches this season, a six-game losing streak and two more of five. They lost five straight between March 20-28 but have since won six in a row.
It wouldnât be a stretch to say that heading into the final weekend of the regular season, this city is beside itself breathing playoff-perfumed air.

Brendan Gallagher, wearing No. 73 before he switched to No. 11, skates against the Florida Panthers on Jan. 22, 2013 at Bell Centre.

Gallagher has been a vital part of the season, getting 38 points (21 goals, 17 assists) and not missing a single game. His offensive output is his best since 2019-20, when he put up 43 points (22 goals, 21 assists).
The energy will build to a fever pitch next week with Montrealâs final two home games -- Monday against the Chicago Blackhawks and Wednesday against the Carolina Hurricanes -- before it would hit (the cityâs fingers crossed) a playoff crescendo.
âIâm maybe the only player on this team who has seen what this building can feel like and sound like come playoff time, itâs been so long,â Gallagher said. âI think weâre getting a little taste here game by game. You can see more and more energy, the enthusiasm of the fans. Itâs definitely not an easy building for other teams.

Brendan Gallagher attempts to get at Florida Panthersâ Niko Mikkola at the end of their game at Amerant Bank Arena on March 30, 2025 in Sunrise, Florida.

âThe Bell Centre and the crowd have such an impact on the game. Weâre just excited. Iâm proud of the group, weâre enjoying the opportunity and the moment, weâre not letting it get too big for us. Weâre just staying within ourselves, taking each day as a new challenge and seeing what we can do.â
The Canadiensâ greatest strength, Gallagher suggests, has been their resilience, a bond and chemistry built more during the hard times than the good.
There is a belief the players have in themselves, he says, no matter what the scoreboard reads.
âThereâs not much we havenât seen at this point,â Gallagher said. âWeâre resilient, weâre tough to put away. Itâs something that I think is a real strength of ours.â
He has very much grown up in Montreal, becoming a veteran, a leader, a husband and a father. His leadership has been exemplary, a rugged by-example member of a core group for a decade.

âThereâs a time and a place to speak up,â Gallagher said. âThatâs part of learning and maturing as a leader, understanding when to speak, when to pull a guy aside, when to let the guys be themselves.
âThere are a lot of different ways to lead. Just understand the situation, just go with your feel and your instincts, try to do whatâs best for the group at all times. If you get a chance to help an individual, you try to do it the best you can.â
Montreal coach Martin St. Louis values what Gallagher brings to the ice and the dressing room.
âI think heâs pulled the group into the fight every night,â St. Louis said on Thursday. âYou know what youâre going to get from 'Gally.' Heâs going to empty the tank every night, heâll give you everything he has.

Brendan Gallagher is congratulated by his teammates after scoring a goal against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on March 20, 2025.

âYou know exactly where heâs going to be. Heâs going to be around the net, heâs going to win battles in the corners. Iâm so happy for the kind of season that heâs had this year. When I took this job (45 games into the 2020-21 season), he was running into some injury issues, he was swimming against the current.
âBut heâs been healthy for a while now and his game this year has been very consistent. His whole career, 'Gally' has found a way to score. I think a healthy Gallagher can still score in this League and heâs shown that this year.â
Gallagher has two years remaining on his contract, but anything beyond that isnât anywhere on his radar with the Canadiens surging toward the postseason.
âEvery once in a while someone will ask me about my contract, and Iâll think about it a little bit,â he said. âBut as of now, I have no plans. Iâm just enjoying what Iâm doing. I still feel that Iâm able to do my job and I wonât make a decision until the day comes that I feel that I canât.

Brendan Gallagher stretches at the bench during warmup before the Canadiensâ March 18, 2025 Bell Centre game against the Ottawa Senators.

âMontreal is really a second home for me, the way they treat myself and my family. I couldnât imagine my life without Montreal. From Day 1, Iâve just embraced the passion that theyâve shown, their enthusiasm. Every time that Iâve put on the Canadiens sweater has meant a lot to me. Maybe thereâs something about the way I play that resonates with fans. Iâve had nothing but positive experiences here and Montreal will always be a part of my life.â
Itâs all part of Gallagherâs big picture in Montreal, his seventh trip to the playoffs tantalizingly close. Heâs enjoying every second of it while knowing full well that nothing has been accomplished until he sees an âXâ beside Montreal Canadiens in the standings.
âIt may sound silly, but until youâre in, youâre not in,â he said. âOur entire focus is we have to win games and clinch our spot. After that, whoever you play, you play. Itâs going to be a tough challenge no matter your opponent. Most likely youâre going to be the underdog, which is a situation weâre familiar with, but right now itâs just about getting in.
âWhatâs happening now has been special, for everyone.â

The Utah Hockey Club failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs in its first season in the NHL.
Utah (36-30-12) was eliminated from contention when the Minnesota Wild defeated the San Jose Sharks 8-7 in overtime Wednesday.
The NHL established a new franchise in Utah on April 18. Utah acquired the hockey assets of the inactive Arizona Coyotes franchise, which had missed the playoffs the previous four seasons.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for Utah and why things could be better next season.

What went wrong
Adjustment to new home: Utah had six months to put a new team in a new market. It moved executives, coaches, players and staff from Arizona. It did initial renovations of Delta Center while planning more for the future, built a temporary practice facility while breaking ground on a permanent one, designed inaugural uniforms while working on a permanent brand identity, and much more. Delta Center, home of the Utah Jazz of the NBA, currently has 11,131 seats with a full view of the ice, and the team has sold them out each game. But Utah ranks 25th in the NHL in home points percentage at .538 (18-15-7).
Absences: Utah has lost more than 230 man-games to injuries. Most notably, defenseman Sean Durzi missed 52 games because of a shoulder injury sustained in October, defenseman John Marino missed the first 42 games of the season because of a back injury, center Nick Bjugstad was out for 16 because of various injuries, and forward Dylan Guenther was out for 12 games because of a lower-body injury sustained Jan. 8. Goalie Connor Ingram took a leave of absence after losing his mother to breast cancer in December and entered the NHL/NHLPA player assistance program March 9, posting on social media that he had realized he had not been himself after trying to return to play.
Inconsistency and scoring depth: Inconsistent from period to period and game to game, Utah went on a 6-0-2 run from Dec. 7-22, but hasnât had a winning streak longer than four games. It averages 2.87 goals per game, tied with the Vancouver Canucks for 20th in the NHL, and has 149 5-on-5 goals, 21st in the League. Forward Lawson Crouse has 12 goals after scoring at least 20 each of the past three seasons. Forward Matias Maccelli has eight goals after scoring 17 last season. Bjugstad has six goals after scoring 22 last season.
Reasons for optimism
Clayton Keller: Utah named Keller its first captain Oct. 4, and the forward has lived up to it, leading the team in goals (27), assists (57) and points (84). He has a chance to pass the NHL career high of 86 points (37 goals, 49 assists) he had in 2022-23. Although he is nine seasons into his NHL career, heâs still only 26. He turns 27 on July 29.
Building blocks: Guenther, who turned 22 on Thursday, scored the first goal in Utah history Oct. 8 and is second on the team with 26 goals. Forward Logan Cooley, who turns 21 on May 4, is third with 23 goals. Utah has the ability to make moves with salary cap space and extra picks in the NHL Draft, including three selections in the second round and two in the third for the 2026 NHL Draft.
Improvements: A permanent brand identity is in the works. Renovations will continue at Delta Center during the offseason, and the permanent practice facility is scheduled to be ready for training camp in September. Ninety percent of season-ticket members will renew for next season. Salt Lake City quickly has become a hockey town, and Utah only is beginning to establish itself in the NHL. Things should only get better on and off the ice.

The Vancouver Canucks failed to qualify for the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs after finishing first in the Pacific Division last season.
The Canucks (36-29-13) were eliminated from contention when the Minnesota Wild defeated the San Jose Sharks 8-7 in overtime Wednesday.
Vancouver was unable to build on its first-place finish and six-game win against the Nashville Predators in the Western Conference First Round last season. The Canucks have missed the playoffs in four of the past five seasons.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Canucks and why things could be better next season.

What went wrong
Demko injury: Thatcher Demko sustained a knee injury during Game 1 of the playoffs against the Predators last season, on April 19, 2024, and the goalie didn't play his first game this season until Dec. 10, missing the first 26 games. Demko, a finalist last season for the Vezina Trophy given to the best goalie in the NHL, struggled to play at the same level as he had the previous season. He then sustained a lower-body injury during a 2-1 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Feb. 8 and missed an additional 15 games. Demko is 10-8-3 with a 2.90 goals-against average and .889 save percentage in 23 games. He was 35-14-2 with a 2.45 GAA and .918 save percentage in 51 games last season. Had Demko been healthy for the entire season, things could have been different for the Canucks.
Inner turmoil: A reported rift between forwards Elias Pettersson and J.T. Miller was confirmed by Canucks president of hockey operations Jim Rutherford in a newspaper interview Jan. 28. Pettersson and Miller had been feuding for most of the season, according to Rutherford, and attempts to resolve it internally were ineffective. Miller was traded to the New York Rangers on Jan. 31 for forward Filip Chytil, defenseman Victor Mancini and a first-round pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. The Canucks were one point out of a playoff spot on the day of the trade, and have gone 13-12-3 since.
Pettersson struggles: Pettersson's production has dropped off dramatically since he had 102 points (39 goals, 63 assists) in 80 games in 2022-23. He had 89 points (34 goals, 55 assists) in 82 games last season and has 45 points (15 goals, 30 assists) in 64 games this season. Pettersson is in the first season of an eight-year, $92.8 million contract ($11.6 million average annual value) he signed March 2, 2024. It's likely Pettersson's conflict with Miller didn't help, and neither did an upper-body injury he sustained during a 5-3 loss at the Rangers on March 22. He hasn't played since.
Reasons for optimism
Quinn Hughes: Hughes is one of the best defensemen in the NHL, and he's having another season worthy of consideration for the Norris Trophy as the best at his position. Injuries have been a factor, but Hughes still has 74 points (16 goals, 58 assists) in 64 games. Last season's Norris winner, Hughes has been Vancouver's best player on most nights. He can become an unrestricted free agent after the 2026-27 season and one of the Canucks' top priorities will be to keep him in Vancouver beyond that.
Opportunity to reset: Things did not go as expected for Vancouver this season, but they have a chance to step back and reassess for next season. The Canucks still have a talented core with Hughes, Pettersson, Demko, forwards Jake DeBrusk, Conor Garland, Dakota Joshua and Teddy Blueger. Demko also will have an opportunity to put in a full offseason of work and start next season healthy. Vancouver will have a chance to add through free agency and hope a few prospects are able to make the jump to the NHL next season. With a few tweaks and some better individual seasons, the Canucks should be a playoff contender again next season.
DeBrusk: The 28-year-old forward has had a productive first season with the Canucks after signing a seven-year, $38.5 million contract ($5.5 million AAV) July 1. He has 45 points (25 goals, 20 assists) in 78 games, the second-highest total in his eight NHL seasons. He's been effective and showed himself to be capable of playing up and down the lineup while providing a physical presence. DeBrusk played his first seven seasons with the Boston Bruins and was in the playoffs every season. He brings experience to the lineup and should be a mainstay in Vancouver through the duration of his contract.

The Buffalo Sabres failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for an NHL-record 14th consecutive season.
The Sabres (35-36-6) were eliminated from contention when the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Detroit Red Wings 4-1 on Tuesday. They haven't qualified since 2010-11 after reaching the playoffs in four of six seasons.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Sabres and why things could be better next season.
The skinny
Potential unrestricted free agents: Kale Clague, D; James Reimer, G; Felix Sandstrom, G
Potential restricted free agents: Ryan McLeod, F; Jack Quinn, F; JJ Peterka, F; Tyson Kozak, F; Bowen Byram, D; Jacob Bernard-Docker, D; Erik Brannstrom, D; Devon Levi, G.
Potential 2025 Draft picks: 10
What went wrong
Unlucky 13: On Nov. 26, the Sabres were 11-9-1 and fourth in the Atlantic Division, five points behind the division-leading Toronto Maple Leafs. The following day, Buffalo lost 1-0 to the Minnesota Wild at KeyBank Center, the start of an 0-10-3 skid that would essentially leave them out of Stanley Cup Playoff contention before Christmas. The Sabres were outscored 53-28 and were tied with the Chicago Blackhawks for last in the NHL on Dec. 22. It simply was too much of a deficit to recover, even with more than half a season remaining.
Net pains: Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen signed a five-year, $23.75 million contract ($4.75 million average annual value) July 24 and the Sabres were confident they had their No. 1 goalie for the present and the future. Luukkonen is 24-23-4 with a 3.23 goals-against average, .885 save percentage and two shutouts after going 27-22-4 with a 2.57 GAA, .910 save percentage and five shutouts in an NHL career-high 54 games (51 starts) last season. Buffalo is 29th in GAA (3.43) and 31st in save percentage (.880).
Not-so-special teams: The Sabres are 26th on the power play (18.2 percent) and 23rd on the penalty kill (76.6 percent). Their special teams have not been stable enough to translate into winning consistently.
Reasons for optimism
Tage's time: Tage Thompson has returned to being a point-per-game player with 71 points (44 goals, 27 assists) after his production fell by 38 points last season (56 points; 29 goals, 27 assists) from 2022-23 (94 points; 47 goals, 47 assists). The forward is 27 years old and entering the prime of his career.
Offense from defense: The Sabres have three defensemen ranked in the top 31 in scoring at the position: Rasmus Dahlin (sixth, 62 points), Owen Power (tied for 22nd, 40 points) and Bowen Byram (tied for 28th, 37 points). Dahlin is 24 years old, Power is 22 and Byram, a potential restricted free agent, is 23. These three easily form the present and future strength of the Sabres.
Developing Devon: Devon Levi is 17-17-2 with a 3.29 GAA and .894 save percentage in 39 NHL games (36 starts). The Sabres deserve credit for allowing him to develop with Rochester of the American Hockey League for much of this season, which has allowed him to regain his confidence. The 23-year-old is 24-10-4 with a 2.17 GAA, .920 save percentage and an AHL-high seven shutouts. Given Luukkonen's struggles, Levi looks like he's getting ready to become a staple at the NHL level.

CHICAGO -- When Shea Theodore sustained an upper-body injury in Canadaâs first game of the 4 Nations Face-Off, the disappointment was twofold. Not only was the Vegas Golden Knights defenseman denied the chance to continue playing on an international stage, he would also miss several NHL games.
âI was looking forward to that tournament for so long, a chance to prove myself and where I am around the League. That was tough,â Theodore said. âAt the same time, I was able to get some good rest and kind of mentally prepare for what we have coming up.â
What he and the Golden Knights have coming up, they hope, is another playoff run that ends with the second Stanley Cup championship in their history. Theodore may have missed the remainder of the international tournament, but heâs definitely made an impact in the NHL throughout his career.
Theodore has a career-high 54 points (seven goals, 47 assists) in 63 games, fourth for Vegas in scoring behind forwards Jack Eichel (93 points), Mark Stone (67) and Tomas Hertl (59). He leads Golden Knights defensemen with 19 power-play points and is averaging 21:49 of ice time per game, second for Vegas behind defenseman Alex Pietrangelo (22:24).
âI think just itâs the way he skates and transports the puck,â Golden Knights defenseman Brayden McNabb said of Theodore. âHe creates a lot of offense for our guys up front and getting the puck in their hands when heâs up the ice, a good fourth man, and attacks. Heâs huge that way, and defensively heâs been rock solid this year.â

The No. 26 pick by the Anaheim Ducks at the 2013 NHL Draft, Theodore has 360 points (78 goals, 282 assists) in 560 regular-season games with the Ducks and Golden Knights. He has 68 points (15 goals, 53 assists) in 114 playoff games. He helped Vegas reach the Stanley Cup Final in its inaugural season of 2017-18 and win the Cup in 2022-23.
Thedore sustained an upper-body injury after he was checked into the boards by Adrian Kempe at 2:23 of the second period of Canadaâs 4-3 overtime win against Sweden in the 4 Nations Face-Off opener Feb. 12. He missed the rest of the best-on-best tournament and 14 games out of the break for the Golden Knights.
But Theodore returned March 25 for Vegasâ 5-1 win at the Minnesota Wild, and he has six assists in his past eight games while averaging 20:00 of ice time.
âI mean, I was in a pretty good rhythm going into that (4 Nations) tournament and I had a good start. There were a lot of things I felt were going well,â Theodore said. âNow Iâll just try and find my game as fast as I can here and try and build.
âMissing an extended period, itâs not always easy coming back. But itâs nice that we have [some] games left to gear up and get my game together for the playoffs.â
Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said Theodoreâs absence was clearly visible.
âHis neutral-zone transition. His ability to make, I donât want to say something out of nothing, but he passes the puck, to me, in the neutral zone as good as any defenseman Iâve been around,â Cassidy said. âJust tape to tape, rarely misses his target. He moves laterally so well.
âThe second part is the (offensive)-zone blue-line play. The first goal we scored (against Minnesota on March 25), he loses people up there. Heâs a hard guy to check because of his lateral ability and his first step is excellent. He tends then to make a play toward the net, and it works out well for us. Heâs also good on the power play but âHannyâ (defenseman Noah Hanifin) kind of filled in there. But those two elements, theyâre hard to replace.â

It's fine-tuning time for Vegas (47-22-9), which has already clinched a playoff berth and is first in the Pacific Division, six points ahead of the Los Angeles Kings and 10 ahead of the Edmonton Oilers.
Fortunately, Vegas has a healthy Theodore back in the mix.
âHeâs going to be great,â Cassidy said. âThis time of the year, sometimes a guy that does miss [time] could be a bit of a bonus because guys are kind of looking ahead sometimes this time of year, especially guys who have been in the League. But heâs excited to be out there.â

PHILADELPHIA -- Columbus Blue Jackets broadcaster Jody Shelley does what a lot of retired NHL players do when they think back to their playing days.
The game between the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday (7:30 p.m. ET; MAX, truTV, TNT, TVAS) opened the box of what-if's he has from his 12-season career.
Because 15 years ago, he was a Rangers forward starting a season-ending, home-and-home set against the Flyers that began April 9, 2010, in New York and ended with a shootout victory two days later in Philadelphia that launched one team on an unlikely path to the Stanley Cup Final while the other was left sitting home and watching.
"[The Flyers] were down 3-0 to Boston that year," Shelley said. "You look at all those things that went right for them to get where they made it. You always look back in your career at moments like that, think what-if. That's what happens with retired players. ... Being a Ranger was so great, and being in that moment.
"We got on the train and came back to New York, and they went on."
The Flyers season had been a roller coaster ride. It began with high expectations following the offseason acquisition of defenseman Chris Pronger, but a slow start led to the firing of coach John Stevens on Dec. 3, 2009, who was replaced by Peter Laviolette. They were 14th of 15 teams in the Eastern Conference on Dec. 21.
"We were a very good team, we believed in ourselves," said Brian Boucher, a Flyers goalie that season and now a broadcaster for the team. "We just had a lot of issues throughout the year."
The Rangers were in their first full season under coach John Tortorella, who had replaced Tom Renney on Feb. 23, 2009. They had their own ups and downs but were 6-1-1 entering the final weekend of the regular season and needed to win both games to reach the postseason.
It was a run Shelley said was sparked in part by a conversation he had with Mark Messier the day after a 2-1 loss to the Boston Bruins on March 21 left them five points out of a playoff spot with 10 games remaining.
"I went into the lunchroom, and Mark Messier was sitting there by himself," Shelley said. "Everyone was crowded around one table ... so I asked 'Mess' if I could sit with him. He asked, 'How was practice today?' I said it was a little down, which was to be expected. We kind of feel like we didn't do ourselves a favor. And he said to me, 'You guys have 10 games left. That's an eighth of your season. There's a lot of hockey left. And so you guys have got to realize the opportunity you have. You're not out of it.'
"I left that conversation, and the next day in practice, I talked to [team captain Chris] Drury, and I said the same thing. I said we got a lot of hockey left here. We got to make sure we understand the opportunity. And then we had a meeting and that was the message, let's get this together and realize the opportunity we have and we kind of went on a run there. I'm not saying it was the meeting. It just kind of was a mindset of, hey, there's a lot to go."
And it was Shelley surprisingly keying the charge in Game 81. Midway through the first period, Shelley found himself alone in the slot after a face-off in the Philadelphia zone, and he beat Boucher for his first goal of the season to put the Rangers ahead 2-1 at 10:13.

Brandon Dubinsky pushed the lead to 3-1 at 6:58 of the second period before the Flyers tied it on goals by Daniel Brière and Mike Richards.
Marian Gaborik scored the game-winner when he stole the puck from Pronger at the Flyers blue line and scored at 16:54 for the 4-3 final.
Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist made 10 saves in the third to preserve the lead.
"We were down by one, goalie pulled and we tried frantically to tie it," Boucher said. "I just remember watching from the bench us not scoring, and seeing 'Hank' celebrate. And I was so mad that we weren't able to get two points that game. I really wanted to make it right on home ice the next one. So I was excited for it. I wouldn't say extra motivated, because there's plenty to be motivated for, but I was fired up for the next game."
The Flyers practiced Saturday with a plan.
"When we got in that morning, it was one of those things where 'Lavi' had a hunch," Briere said. "He had a hunch that the game would get to a shootout."
Laviolette had Briere, Richards, Claude Giroux, Simon Gagne and Jeff Carter watch video of Lundqvist in shootouts before practice, and then work on their shootout moves after.
"He asked us to pick a move or two and work on that and at the end of practice ... the five of us stayed extra and took shootout practice on our goalies," Briere said.
The Rangers also worked on shootouts at the end of practice Saturday, but that was a daily occurrence.
"We did that every practice with Hank, all those guys did that every practice," Shelley said. "Hank did it after every single practice pretty much, he practiced shootouts."
In the five seasons the shootout had been in place to that point, Lundqvist was second with 30 shootout wins and his .755 save percentage was fourth among goalies to play in at least 15 shootouts.
It wasn't long after the puck dropped in Philadelphia on Sunday that New York took a 1-0 lead when Shelley tipped a Michal Rozsival shot past Boucher at 3:27.

It marked the only time Shelley scored in back-to-back NHL games.
"Got him a nice three-year deal," Boucher said of Shelley, who signed a three-year contract with the Flyers on July 1, 2010.
The Flyers tied the game in the second period on Matt Carle's power-play goal, but that was all they could get, despite outshooting the Rangers 47-25 through overtime.
"I felt they were just defending to get to overtime and get to a shootout," Briere said. "I probably would have done the same thing with the goalie they had."
Briere went first in the shootout, and he immediately flashed back to his post-practice work from the day before. He skated through the middle of the ice, deked and lifted a shot over Lundqvist's left pad.
"I knew exactly what I was going to do," he said. "I usually always had three options going into a shootout. But in this one, I had seen Lundqvist enough. I had had enough shootouts against him and seen him enough, I knew which way I went. I just had to get it over his pad."
It may have looked smooth, but Briere, who was in the third season of an eight-year, $52 million contract ($6.5 million average annual value) that made him the highest paid player on the team, said he needed an extra moment to gather himself.
"I jumped on the ice and then all kinds of thoughts went to my head," he said. "You start thinking about, 'Oh, my God, this is for a lot of money.' And then you start thinking, 'This is why they brought me in.' If you see the clip, I take a detour. I go and I take my time, because I needed to reset and get in the right frame of mind, because I was at the wrong place, and I had to refocus and start thinking about, 'OK, you know your move, you've practiced it 10-12 times yesterday. You can make it. See the net. Don't see the goalie, just see the net. See the net.' And then I just put it back in place.
"I can't even tell you what the fans were doing, what our bench was doing. I don't know if our players were standing or sitting. I don't know if the fans were standing or sitting. I don't know if we had music was playing. I don't remember anything. It's like zoomed in. There's a baseball movie about that, 'For Love of the Game,' when [Kevin Costner] starts pitching, and you see everything shuts down. It was one of those moments.
"You always talk about that and you want to get there. This was the clearest example that I've ever faced in my career, where I could see the difference of just shutting out everything and just focusing on that. Because when you play, there's so many players, there's so many things going on, so you can't just close off on kind of one target. But this is a 1-on-1. Nobody's in the way between you and the goalie. It was really cool at that moment how everything shuts down, and I don't know anything else, except the path to the goalie. It was awesome."
Rangers forward Erik Christensen was next. To that point, his 52.9 percent success rate on shootouts (18 goals on 34 attempts) was third among all players, but Boucher got his blocker on the attempt.
Richards tried to score blocker side, but Lundqvist turned it aside with his stick.
PA Parenteau, the Rangers' second shooter, scored when his attempt ramped up Boucher's stick and over his shoulder.
"I backed in too quickly on the second one," Boucher said. "And even though Parenteau lost it, it went off my stick and up and over me. But I was backing in too fast and I think nerves were getting to me."
He had a chance to settle himself while Giroux scored on his attempt, skating through the middle of the ice, slowing at the hash marks, and snapping a shot between Lundqvist's pads.
Olli Jokinen was next over the boards for the Rangers.
A goal kept New York's season alive. A save clinched the win and the postseason for Philadelphia.
Jokinen was 5-for-10 on shootouts to that point in 2009-10, but none of the attempts had come against the Flyers.
"Didn't really have a book on him," Boucher said. "I think what you're trying to do in that moment is to not let the enormity of the situation eat you up. Admittedly, I was very nervous for that shootout. Hank is the best shootout goalie we've ever seen, and it felt like they were playing to get to the shootout. You could feel it. You could sense it after we tied it, that that's what they were trying to get to, knowing that they had the best shootout goal in the world. I just was trying to just calm myself down and not get ahead of myself, focus in."
Jokinen started his run-up to the puck from the goal line in the Rangers end and hit center ice at full speed. He skated in and tried to deke Boucher's pads open, but Boucher kept his stick down and made the save.
"Fortunately for me Jokinen tried to go five hole, and I had five hole covered," Boucher said. "Probably everywhere else I didn't."

As Boucher danced a one-legged jig into a jubilant pile of Flyers, the Rangers skated into the offseason.
"It's crazy ... you think of that moment and think of the magnitude in the last game," Shelley said. "Down the stretch, it was just playing hockey, and we had the best goalie in the world in Henrik Lundqvist."
The Flyers' remarkable run continued with a rally from 3-0 down against the Boston Bruins in the second round, and ended in overtime of Game 6 of the Final against the Chicago Blackhawks.
But what if Lundqvist makes one more save? What if Jokinen scores the winner?
That Flyers team had high expectations, and it's likely there would have been changes, from the general manager's suite to the roster.
"We had some big-time players," said Briere, in his third season as Flyers general manager. "There's a lot of money spent on our salaries. We were supposed to win. We had a team built to win. I really don't know what would have happened, but I'm sure that it would not have been pretty."
Could the Rangers have had the same kind of run if they had gotten in? Shelley noted the core of that group reached the Eastern Conference Final in 2012, and the Stanley Cup Final in 2014.
"We had some great pieces, [Ryan] Callahan, Dubinsky," he said. "Everyone had a role, Gaborik, everybody was there, [Dan] Girardi was there, [Marc] Staal.
"I needed to score one more goal."

John Davidson has been doing his homework.  
The Hall of Fame broadcaster and longtime NHL executive has been watching the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers. He's been talking to people who know each team well, including former Flyers coach John Tortorella.  
Basically, Davidson has been doing what he did for 20 years, from 1986-2006, preparing to call a Rangers game on television with Sam Rosen, which is exactly what he will be doing for one final time Wednesday.  
Rosen and Davidson, best known to Rangers fans as "Sam and J.D." during their two decades together on MSG Networks, will be back in the broadcast booth together at Madison Square Garden to call the game between the Rangers and Flyers for TNT (7:30 p.m. ET; MAX, truTV, TNT, TVAS).  
Rosen is retiring at the end of this season after 40 years of being the television voice of the Rangers. Davidson, who shifted into an executive role in 2006, is living in Florida and is a senior advisor in the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey operations department.  
"Sam has had such a great career and a great season," Davidson said. "We're very good friends because our working relationship grew into a friendship, family wise and everything. This is going to be like going to see a hockey game at the NHL level with one of your best friends. It doesn't get any better than that."  
The idea to call the game together was first floated to Rosen and Davidson by the NHL and TNT as a way for the League and its national broadcast partner to join in on the celebration of Rosen's last season as the full-time television voice of the Rangers.  
It's a run that started in the 1984-85 season. He announced his retirement effective the end of this season on Aug. 13, 2024.  
"John and I are still very close, we stay in touch all the time and our wives are in touch," Rosen said. "We've remained very close friends so when the idea was floated out there it was something that excited both of us and it's come to fruition. We're really looking forward to it. I talked to John (Saturday) and he's preparing like we're doing any other game. He says, 'I've talked to 'Torts' and I've got some ideas.' John, he goes to something like this at 120 percent, so he'll be ready to go and I'm looking forward to it."  
All season it's been a whirlwind final tour through the League for Rosen. He's been getting gifts and acknowledgments for his Hall of Fame hockey broadcasting career wherever he's gone with the Rangers.  
Jon Cooper gave him a bottle of wine he hopes to share with the Tampa Bay Lightning coach after the Rangers play at Amalie Arena on April 17.  
Former Rangers captain Jacob Trouba, now with the Anaheim Ducks, gave Rosen one of his paintings.  
Minnesota Wild forward Mats Zuccarello wore a special jersey to honor Rosen in warmups at Madison Square Garden on April 2. It had the No. 40 on the back and ROSEN for the nameplate.  
The Rangers honored Rosen with a special ceremony before their game against the Vancouver Canucks on March 22. They called it "Salute to Sam" and celebrated him throughout the game.

But getting to call a game with Davidson one last time is not something he thought would be possible because the NHL's rightsholders have their regular broadcasters; Rosen isn't one of them and Davidson hasn't been a regular in the booth in 19 years.  
"When I got the call from the producer, Kevin Brown, then I knew it was real," Rosen said. "First, I was waiting and wondering, were they just throwing feelers out and might they not do the game because the Flyers aren't in the playoff picture and the Rangers have been up and down, but at that point when the call came, I knew, 'OK, we're doing the game, let's go.'  
"This is a real special moment. It's an addition you didn't know was going to happen."  
Rosen and Davidson last called a Rangers game together on April 29, 2006. It was Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, a 4-2 loss to the New Jersey Devils that ended New York's 2005-06 season in a sweep.  
Davidson, known for his signature âOh Babyâ call while with the Rangers, left the broadcast booth after that season to become an NHL executive, first with the St. Louis Blues, then the Rangers and finally the Columbus Blue Jackets. He transitioned into a senior adviser role with the Blue Jackets after last season.  
But he has called five Blue Jackets games this season with Steve Mears on FanDuel Sports Network Ohio. He watches games nightly, including regularly taking in Rosen's call on the Rangers' broadcasts.  
"This is another great example of our terrific partnership with our national rightsholders, as we are constantly brainstorming unique and creative approaches to our broadcasts," NHL president of content, events and productions Steve Mayer said. "We wanted to celebrate Sam Rosen's incredible career and thought that there could be no more fitting way than by reuniting him with his longtime partner and fellow Hall of Famer, John Davidson. This will be a celebration for the entire NHL and particularly special for New York hockey fans. And we are delighted that TNT embraced the opportunity to give this duo the microphones for the night."  
Rosen and Davidson expect to seamlessly fall back into their old ways as Sam and J.D.  
"I don't see why we wouldn't," Davidson said. "We're just going to go there and call a game that's hopefully a really good hockey game and just have fun doing it."  
That's what they did for two decades. They were the voices of the Rangers when they won the Stanley Cup in 1994. They were there in the lean times, like when the Rangers missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs for seven straight seasons from 1998-2004.  
"When you've got a broadcaster there for 40 years, there's generations of Rangers fans that grew up listening to that voice," Davidson said. "It's a very important part of the fabric of sports. People identify a lot with that voice. I still have people come up to me and say, 'J.D., thanks for teaching me the game.' In fact, I went for an MRI today and I was going in and a Rangers fan was right there and he told me I taught him the game. It's just great. People remember. Times change, of course, but people remember. There's a bond there. There's a tremendous bond. The broadcasters, if they're doing their jobs, they're the conduit between the fan and the team."  
Rosen has been for 40 years, half that time spent with Davidson. His mic will turn off after this season, but for one last time it'll be Sam and J.D. together in the broadcast booth and the Rangers on the ice at Madison Square Garden.  
"I just want us to have fun," Davidson said. "I don't want at all to be the center of any attention, the game should be, but we'll do our best to have people enjoy the broadcast. It'll be fun. It'll be a great deal of fun."

TORONTO -- When it comes to projecting who might break Alex Ovechkinâs all-time goal record of 895 one day, Auston Matthews doesnât think heâs even in the same league as the Great 8.
Having heard that Toronto Maple Leafs teammate Matthew Knies suggested Matthews might be a candidate to eclipse Ovechkinâs mark years down the road, the Toronto captain quickly squashed the idea.
âThatâs such a long way away or such a long way to go,â Matthews said after practice Monday. âAnd, you know, I donât even think I should be in that conversation.
âI mean, this guy just broke the record. Iâm so far away from that, and I donât think that should be a focus on myself. I mean, it should be on Ovi, and rightfully so. It should be on Ovi, and what heâs been able to accomplish in his career, and obviously this record being one of them.â
Ovechkin surpassed Wayne Gretzky as the NHL career goal leader when he scored on the power play at 7:26 of the second period during his Washington Capitalsâ 4-1 loss at the New York Islanders on Sunday. The game was immediately halted for a ceremony honoring the milestone, including Gretzky congratulating the 39-year-old Capitals captain on the ice.

Knies was asked Monday if he could wrap his head around the possibility that someone might break this new record one day.
âItâs pretty crazy,â the Maple Leafs forward said. âObviously, I canât count that high. Itâs pretty astonishing, but yeah, maybe weâll see it down the line. â3-4â could do it.â
Knies was referring to Matthews, who wears No. 34. Several minutes later, during his own media scrum, Matthews shot down the idea.
Of course, however much Matthews doesnât want to talk about the concept, his numbers speak for themselves.
According to NHL Stats, the 27-year-old has the fifth-highest career goals per game (minimum 200 goals) in NHL history at 0.64, trailing only Mike Bossy (0.76), Mario Lemieux (0.75), Cy Denneny (0.75) and Babe Dye (0.75). Pavel Bure is sixth (0.62) and Ovechkin seventh (0.60).
Matthews has 398 goals in 623 career games, 497 shy of Ovechkinâs mark. At his current goals-per-game pace, he would need 778 more games to reach 896 goals, one more than Ovechkinâs record. Based on an 82-game season, that translates to about nine-and-a-half more seasons.
That, of course, would be excluding time missed due to injury. Given that heâs only played all 82 games just once in his career, that coming during his rookie season of 2016-17, it would take longer than that.
Should Matthews play each of the Maple Leafsâ final six regular-season games, he would have averaged 69.66 games per season in his career. At that rate, it would take him just over 11 seasons to reach Ovechkinâs record, which equates to early in the 2036-37 season. Matthews would be 39 years old at the time, the same age as Ovechkin now.

There, of course, are other factors involved.
How many more goals, for example, will Ovechkin have before he retires?
How healthy can Matthews remain?
And how long will Matthewsâ totals be augmented by elite wins like his linemate Mitch Marner, who is eligible to become an unrestricted free agent July 1?
None of these questions are of concern right now to Matthews, who, like the rest of the hockey world, just enjoyed watching Ovechkin create history.
âPretty cool,â he said. âI think just to be able to witness that, I just felt like everything went right there. I mean, it was in his spot (left face-off circle), on the power play, the celebration â¦ everything was amazing.
âAnd it was pretty cool to witness that record being broken. I mean, kind of like, obviously, Wayne Gretzky, the amount of goals you have to score, the consistency, and everything that goes into it. So, itâs obviously pretty cool to witness that.â
He chuckled when it was pointed out that Ovechkin eats submarine sandwiches as a pregame meal and enjoys a few beers every now and then, not actually the health regimen many modern day NHLers adhere to.
âI mean, I think heâs just built different than most people, probably, and just kind of has that X-factor,â Matthews said. âSo, I donât know.
âI mean, everyoneâs different, but heâs obviously a bit of a specimen.â
Matthews needs just two goals to reach 400 in the NHL. But heâs more concerned with his teamâs upcoming road trip through Florida, which starts at the Florida Panthers on Tuesday (7 p.m. ET; ESPN, TSN4) and also includes a visit to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Wednesday.
Back-to-back wins certainly would leave the Maple Leafs in prime position to finish first in the Atlantic Division. They entered Tuesday in first place with 98 points, two ahead of the Lightning (45-26-6) and six in front of the Panthers (44-29-4). Toronto has a game in hand on each.
The injury-plagued Panthers have lost five consecutive games (0-4-1), but Matthews said the defending Stanley Cup champions are always a handful.
âTheyâll be ready to go,â he said. âI think the focus for us is on our team, and our group making sure weâre ready in here. But, obviously, theyâre an experienced team, a veteran team.
âYou lose a couple in a row (like the Panthers), you know youâre going to get a good game from them.â

DETROIT -- When the Florida Panthers took the ice Sunday, they did not look like the team that won the Stanley Cup last season.
No Aleksander Barkov. No Sam Bennett. No Aaron Ekblad. No Gustav Forsling, Dmitry Kulikov, Sam Reinhart or Matthew Tkachuk.
Sergei Bobrovsky wasn't in goal, either, because the Panthers were playing their second game in two days.
"I almost wish some of those guys were in the lineup, because you look over in warmup, and you go, 'Well, where is everybody?'" Detroit Red Wings coach Todd McLellan said. "I don't want to disrespect or anything, but you let your guard down a little bit."
The Panthers lost 2-1 at Little Caesars Arena, falling to 0-4-1 in their past five games. It remains to be seen who will be in the lineup in a key Atlantic Division game against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Amerant Bank Arena on Tuesday (7 p.m. ET; ESPN, TSN4).
But don't let your guard down. The Panthers have clinched a berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, and they care less about where they finish in the standings than they do about getting healthy and playing the right way.
With a full lineup, they will have a chance to repeat.
"You always want every advantage that you can possibly get -- home ice and all that," Panthers coach Paul Maurice said. "But we've got to heal some of these guys, and we've got to give ourselves a chance to be physically right when it starts."
Ekblad, one of Florida's top defensemen, is serving a 20-game suspension for violating the terms of the NHL/NHLPA Performance Enhancing Substances Program. He will be eligible to return for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference First Round.
Tkachuk, an emotional leader and star forward, has missed the past 20 games with a lower-body injury. He is expected to return for the first game of the playoffs.

The others are nursing relatively minor ailments. Kulikov, a defenseman who played all 24 of Florida's playoff games last season, has missed the past nine. Barkov, the captain and No. 1 center, has missed three. Bennett and Reinhart, key forwards, each has missed one game. So has Forsling, a defenseman who led Florida in average ice time (23:25) during the playoffs last season.
Maurice said Bennett probably won't play against Toronto on Tuesday. Barkov and Reinhart might. Forsling and Kulikov could return later in the week. The Panthers host the Red Wings on Thursday and the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday.
"We're not really resting guys," Maurice said. "We're just healing them, so if anybody we think we can make major improvements on anything that they're dealing with, we'll pull them and keep them out."
Don't forget that the Panthers acquired defenseman Seth Jones from the Chicago Blackhawks on March 1 and forward Brad Marchand from the Boston Bruins just before the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7, adding more depth and star power. After six straight wins, they were first in the Atlantic Division on March 8, four points ahead of the Maple Leafs and five in front of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
Yes, they've gone 4-8-1 since and slipped to third in the Atlantic, six points behind the Maple Leafs and four behind the Lightning. Suddenly, they're in danger of dropping into the first wild card in the East, only two points ahead of the Ottawa Senators. But from their perspective, who cares who they play in the first round, and from an opponents' perspective, who wants to play them if they're at full strength?
"I wouldn't say it matters where we end up," Panthers forward Mackie Samoskevich said. "You've got to beat everybody if you want to win it all. I think [the focus is on] just not opening up our game, staying tight, working on our forecheck, because that's what works in the playoffs."
The Panthers have scored two goals or fewer in six straight games, but they haven't given up too much lately, either.
They lost 3-2 at the Montreal Canadiens on April 1, when they allowed the tying goal with nine seconds left in the third period and the winner 29 seconds into overtime, which Maurice brushed off as something "that'll never happen again." They lost 3-2 at Toronto on Wednesday and 3-0 at Ottawa on Saturday despite outshooting the Maple Leafs 31-26 and the Senators 39-22. They outshot the Red Wings 33-24 on Sunday.
"It's all structural for us," Maurice said. "We're not scoring goals? I don't care. We want to be in tight games. â¦ If we can maintain our structure right now, then we'll look at this as being a really good thing for us, because that's all we're talking about is the hard parts of our defensive structure, and it's been good to the point that we can survive in a game."
When Barkov, Bennett, Ekblad, Forsling, Kulikov, Reinhart and Tkachuk come back, the other team will have to survive.

DETROIT -- The Detroit Red Wings still have a prayer of making the Stanley Cup Playoffs, so what better place to play a big game than Bell Centre in Montreal?
"It's church, church for hockey," coach Todd McLellan said. "It's where the hockey people go. When they think about a church, that's where they go. That's their cathedral."
Light a candle.
The Red Wings are trying to end an eight-season playoff drought and badly need to defeat the Montreal Canadiens in regulation Tuesday (7 p.m. ET; RDS, TSN2, FDSNDETX).
The Canadiens hold the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference. The Red Wings are six points behind with a game in hand. So are the New York Rangers, who play the Tampa Bay Lightning at Madison Square Garden on Monday (7 p.m. ET; FDSNSUN, MSG, TVAS).
Montreal has won five straight. Detroit is 3-0-1 in its past four.
"Extremely excited," Red Wings forward Lucas Raymond said. "I think it'll be a great game. The atmosphere in Montreal is always good, and what's at stake [matters] as well."
The Red Wings have had an up-and-down season.
They were 13-17-4 at the holiday break Dec. 24-26, eight points behind the Ottawa Senators for the second wild card in the East.
McLellan replaced Derek Lalonde on Dec. 26. They went 15-5-1 leading up to the 4 Nations Face-Off break Feb. 10-21 and had the third best points percentage (.738) in the NHL over that stretch. Only the Washington Capitals (.762) and the Winnipeg Jets (.750) were better.
Detroit held the second wild card at that point.
"I challenged our group after the 4 Nations break," McLellan said. "Who are we? â¦ We talked about, 'The story's not done yet. We can still write another chapter or two, so let's get playing the way we can.'"
The Red Wings went 2-0-1 in their first three games coming out of the break and moved up to the first wild card, then fell out of the playoff picture again. They lost six straight in regulation and went 3-5-0 over their next eight.
Who are they?
Captain Dylan Larkin looked at the positives.
"It's a stressful time right now," he said. "But at Christmas it was â¦ I mean, it was not good. It was bad. We struggled, and [it] felt like it was going to be the longest four months to the end of the season that could be possible, and we were just going to put our equipment on and go out there and play and suck it up.
"But we've battled, and we've had a lot of new faces in the lineup and a lot of young faces, and it's been exciting to see them come in and see how they play and see how they handle the pressure, see how they've grown in this time. There's so much difference from Christmas to now.
"We're still in this, and that's because we didn't quit. We turned it around, and we showed that we can play in big games in pressure environments and win hockey games."
They're going to have to show it again.
A bright spot lately has been 37-year-old goalie Cam Talbot, who is 3-0-1 with a 1.74 goals-against average and .944 save percentage in four consecutive starts.
McLellan said he will start again in Montreal.
"My experience with him, when he gets on a roll and gets playing, get him the rest he needs, make sure he feels good, put him back in," said McLellan, who also coached Talbot with the Edmonton Oilers (2015-19) and Los Angeles Kings (2023-24). "We believe he can keep doing it. He's been excellent."
The Red Wings made a late push for the playoffs last season, finishing with back-to-back 5-4 wins against the Canadiens -- in overtime at home April 15 and a shootout at Bell Centre on April 16. They barely missed out. Although they tied the Capitals with 91 points, Washington ended up with the first wild card in the East thanks to the regulation-wins tiebreaker (32-27).
"I feel like these are the kind of games you want to play," Raymond said. "If you don't get excited for that, I don't know what will. Just a great opportunity. I think we're ready for the task and excited to get out there."
Montreal finished 15th in the East last season, though. The Canadiens are much better this time.
Light a candle.
"It's a big game," Larkin said. "Our season's on the line. We've put ourselves in that position, whether good or bad, and we're going into a hockey game where we've got to win, and that's exciting. Great building to go into and have a game like that."

TORONTO -- The most remarkable aspect of the St. Louis Bluesâ franchise-record 12-game winning streak is just how close management came to shaking up the roster.
Or at least shipping out talent.
What a difference six weeks makes.
When the NHL regular season resumed Feb. 22 after the highly successful 4 Nations Face-Off, the struggling Blues were a sub-.500 team at 25-26-5 for 55 points, eight behind the Vancouver Canucks for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Western Conference. With their postseason hopes dwindling, general manager Doug Armstrong admits St. Louis was strongly considering breaking up the band before the NHL Trade Deadline on March 7.
âIf you took basically the time coming out of the 4 Nations, I would say we were likely going to make deeper cuts,â Armstrong told NHL.com on Sunday.
As the Deadline approached, names like captain Brayden Schenn and goalie Jordan Binnington were prominent in trade speculation.
Then the Blues started winning. Everything changed.
They havenât stopped. In fact, their 5-4 victory against the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday gave them 12 consecutive wins for the first time in Blues history.
In the process, they went from being on the cusp of a retool to being on the verge of a playoff berth in what has been one of the most improbable turnarounds of the 2024-25 NHL regular season.
âIt really has been, especially when you look where we are now,â Armstrong said. âI mean, it wasnât until probably 48 hours before the Deadline that the decision was made to stick with the group we have.â
If ever there was validation to the long-time hockey credo that sometimes the best trades are the ones you donât make, this is it.
âI would say each win eliminated a percentage point or two,â Armstrong said, regarding the odds of the Blues dealing away key cogs. âAnd then, all of a sudden, it got to be quite a bit because our guys had worked their way back into the playoff hunt going into those last couple of games.
âItâs the players who dictated by their play that we wouldnât be moving players the last two days before the Deadline. The odds were stacked against us at the time in terms of winning percentage needed to make the playoffs, but the players had earned the right to stay together. If weâd done anything, it would be a hockey trade.â
The standings reflect just how meteoric this rise has been.
From the conclusion of the 4 Nations Face-Off to the Trade Deadline, St. Louis went 6-1-1 to put itself back into contention, moving within one point of the second wild card. Once the Deadline passed and Blues players realized the team would remain intact, theyâve gone 12-2-1 and hold the first wild card in the West with 93 points (43-28-7).
In summation: Since the 4 Nations Face-Off, the Blues are 18-2-2 heading into their game at the Winnipeg Jets on Monday (7:30 p.m. ET; Prime, NHLN, FDSNMW).
And theyâve done it without some significant contributors.
Defenseman Colton Parayko, a member of Canadaâs 4 Nations championship team along with Binnington, is week to week since injuring his left knee March 5. Forward Pavel Buchnevich missed four games due to illness during the winning streak but has since returned to score in consecutive games. Finally, forward Dylan Holloway is week to week with a lower-body injury sustained against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday.
And, still, the beat goes on.
âTheyâve shown their resiliency,â Armstrong said. âParayko was hurt right at the Deadline, Buchnevich was out for a bit. Holloway now. But weâve received good goaltending. Special teams have been good. And look, you play the teams on your schedule, but the majority of the teams weâve played in this stretch were on the outside of the playoffs looking in. You still have to beat those teams to do it.
âIâm excited the way theyâve handled it.â
Specific praise went to forward Robert Thomas, who has 23 points (four goals, 19 assists) in the past 12 games, the most in the NHL in that span. The leadership shown by Thomas, the 26-year-old who Armstrong said âis becoming a special player right in front of our eyes,â and 25-year-old forward Jordan Kyrou (33 goals in 78 games this season), have the GM believing the recent success is sustainable.
âLook, we havenât clinched anything yet when it comes to making the playoffs,â Armstrong said. âThere still is work to do, but our guys believe in themselves, and thatâs a big thing.
âItâs been impressive to watch.â
Especially given how close the Blues were to being sellers at the Deadline.

BLAZING BINNINGTON
Remember when one of the biggest question marks heading into 4 Nations was the perceived wobbly state of Canadaâs goaltending?
Leave it to Binnington to silence the critics.
The Blues goalie proved to be a difference-maker in the tournament, especially in the championship game when his three enormous saves against Auston Matthews in overtime set the stage for the tournament-winning goal by Connor McDavid.
His dominance didnât stop there.
Since the conclusion of the tournament, Binnington has gone 12-2-0 with a 2.15 goals-against average and .917 save percentage, a key reason for St. Louisâs surge down the stretch. In the process, his victory against Colorado on Saturday set a team record for consecutive wins (12), matched the franchise mark for consecutive home wins (10) and was his 100th home win with the Blues, also a franchise record.
âIt doesnât surprise me,â Armstrong said. âIâve been with Jordan from the start. There were a few years where his numbers may have dipped, but thatâs because the team we had in front of him wasnât good enough.
âHis track record speaks for itself.â
Binnington has been on runs like this before, none more memorable than during his rookie season of 2018-19. He started his first NHL game Jan. 7, 2019, and went on to post a record of 24-5-1 before helping to the Blues win the Stanley Cup.
For Toronto Maple Leafs coach Craig Berube, it is not surprising to see Binningtonâs current success. Berube was the coach in St. Louis for its championship season and knows just how much his former goalie rises to the occasion when his talents are questioned.
âHeâs such a competitor,â Berube said. âAnd if there are any doubters and doubts, he understands it, he hears it, and heâs going to do anything and everything in his power to turn it the other way. Heâs got a lot of jam. Heâll fight for everything. Heâs done it before, right?
âYou never want to doubt him.â
He certainly believes in himself, although there will be no chest pounding on his part. That is not Jordan Binningtonâs way.
âI know better,â he said. âItâs a humbling league, so youâve got to just keep your head down and keep working and find a way and try and find your times to enjoy the moments.â
There has been no shortage of those moments for Binnington these past two months.

JOBU MAGIC, BLUES STYLE
During the Bluesâ 2018-19 Cup run, their rallying cry came in the form of the song âGloria,â the 1982 hit tune for Laura Branigan that St. Louis adopted as its celebration song.
Six years later, the teamâs bonding outlet has come in the form of âJobu,â the voodoo doll featured in the 1989 hit movie âMajor Leagueâ that was presented with rum, cigar and incense offerings by slugger Pedro Cerrano in his locker in the hopes the bobblehead would spiritually help him hit a curveball.
Jobu first appeared in St. Louisâ dressing room on Feb. 22, the day the Blues played the Winnipeg Jets in their first game after the 4 Nations Face-Off. To a man, Blues players claim they donât know how he got there (nudge nudge, wink wink) but have been using him (it?) as inspiration ever since.
"I have no idea where it came from,â Armstrong said. âItâs a playersâ thing. I try to give them their space. But itâs brought them together, and Iâm all for that.â
Jobu now has his own locker in the dressing room between rookies Zack Bolduc and Dalibor Dvorsky and was credited by Binnington as helping St. Louis to a 2-1 win at Colorado on March 29.
âHis second intermission speech got us going,â Binnington said.
In the end, one teamâs Gloria is proving to be anotherâs Jobu.
âI think heâs been a part of this run for us, and we will give him the credit,â defenseman Cam Fowler said. âA little bit of Jobu magic thatâs helped keep this thing alive.â
Whatever works.

MONAHAN STILL STRUGGLING TO COPE
Seven months after the tragic death of Columbus Blue Jackets forward Johnny Gaudreau, Sean Monahan is still trying to find a way to cope with the loss of his beloved friend and teammate.
âObviously, we were really close and, honestly, to this day I donât know how exactly to deal with it myself,â the Blue Jackets center told NHL.com on Saturday. âIt still hits me in waves.
âItâs something I think about every day.â
Johnny and his brother Matthew died Aug. 29 when they were struck by a car while riding bicycles at home in Salem County, New Jersey. Johnny, who played 11 seasons in the NHL with the Blue Jackets and Calgary Flames, was 31. Matthew, who played professionally for five seasons in the American Hockey League, ECHL and Sweden, was 29.
Johnny Gaudreau left behind wife Meredith and three children, all of whom provide Monahan with inspiration and hope.
âHis wife and kids live across the street from us, so I think seeing them, it helps me,â Monahan said. â(Johnny) was a great dad, so being around his kids, it makes you smile.
âHeâs got a great family, and obviously he picked a great wife. Sheâs going to raise three amazing kids that are going to live through some great memories of the best dad those kids could ever hope for.â
Monahan and Gaudreau were longtime teammates with the Flames from 2013-22. Gaudreau signed with Columbus as a free agent in 2022 and, two years later, Monahan did the same, wanting to play with his pal again.
That chance would not come.
Once the season started, Monahan faced more adversity when he injured his right wrist on Jan. 7 and had surgery Jan. 24, leading to a 28-game absence. He returned March 24.
Now, heâs trying to help the Blue Jackets, easily the Cinderella story of the 2024-25 season, qualify for the playoffs. Columbus currently has 77 points (34-33-9), eight behind the Montreal Canadiens for the second wild card in the Eastern Conference.
âThereâs a special bond in this room,â Monahan said. âGuys really care about each other and everyone pushes each other to get better. Thatâs been the case down the stretch here.
âWin or lose, we have a lot of competitors in here. Itâs a really fun team to be a part of.â
And, as such, good therapy for an ever-mourning heart.

QUOTE/UNQUOTE
âI donât want Berubeâs fingerprints anywhere near me.â
-- Blue Jackets coach Dean Evason when asked if he can see Berubeâs fingerprints on the Maple Leafs by the adopted north-south style they are playing. âObviously heâs a great coach,â Evason added. âHe won a Stanley Cup. Have a great deal of respect for him and how he conducts himself and how hard his teams play. Whenever you play a team coached by him, youâre going to get effort from them. Thereâs no question about that.â

THE LAST WORD
A look at one key game with playoff implications for each day this week with less than two weeks remaining in the regular season:
Monday, St. Louis Blues at Winnipeg Jets: St. Louis is closing in on clinching a playoff berth, while Winnipeg looks to win the Presidentsâ Trophy.
Tuesday, Toronto Maple Leafs at Florida Panthers: The defending champions are in danger of falling out of the race for first place in the Atlantic Division.
Wednesday, Maple Leafs at Tampa Bay Lightning: Could go a long way in determining who gets the No. 1 seed in the Atlantic.
Thursday, New York Rangers at New York Islanders: The Islanders are looking to keep their slim playoff hopes alive while trying to squash those of the rival Rangers at the same time.
Friday, Canadiens at Ottawa Senators: In the wild wild-card race in the East, each team has a good shot to make the playoffs.
Saturday, Canadiens at Maple Leafs: Montrealâs playoff aspirations could get a significant boost with a win against its oldest rival.
Sunday, Edmonton Oilers at Jets: Will either member of the Oilersâ banged-up dynamic duo of McDavid and Leon Draisaitl play? Just how healthy, if at all, will they be for the start of the playoffs?

The Boston Bruins failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the first time since 2015-16 after a run of eight consecutive appearances.
The Bruins (31-37-9) were eliminated from contention when the Montreal Canadiens won 3-2 against the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday.
Over the past 17 seasons, the Bruins have only missed the playoffs twice, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, a run that saw them reach the Stanley Cup Final three times and win once, in 2011. They lost the Final in 2013 to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games and in 2019 to the St. Louis Blues in seven games.
Hereâs a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Bruins and why things could be better next season.

What went wrong
Slow start: It was not unexpected that the Bruins might start slow. Goalie Jeremy Swayman missed all of training camp in a contract dispute that was only resolved two days before the season opener. Brad Marchand had three surgeries during the offseason, and David Pastrnak didnât get to train as usual because of injuries as well. But it went far worse than anticipated; Boston lost seven of its first 11 games (4-6-1), with the team eventually firing coach Jim Montgomery on Nov. 19 after a 5-1 loss at home to the Columbus Blue Jackets that left it 8-9-3. The Bruins ended up in a hole they simply could not climb out of, no matter what changes they made or strategies they tried.
Defensive injuries: When a team built on its defense loses its top two defensemen, itâs not going to help. The Bruins saw Hampus Lindholm go down Nov. 12 with what ended up being a season-ending fractured patella. They then lost Charlie McAvoy at the 4 Nations Face-Off in February, with the defenseman sustaining an infection and a significant injury to his AC joint. He has not played since he took the ice in the United States-Canada game on Feb. 15 after getting injured against Finland on Feb. 13. The injuries left the Bruins patching holes in their defense with young, unproven players who couldnât quite fill the gaps.
Lack of scoring: It was 5-on-5, it was special teams, it was everything. The Bruins, who had expected to rely on their defense, didnât have enough offense to make up for it when the defense and goaltending werenât perfect, which they werenât much of the season. Boston is 29th in the NHL at 2.62 goals scored per game. Its power-play percentage is 15.1, also 29th in the League. Outside of Pastrnakâs 94 points (40 goals, 54 assists) in 74 games, the next highest-scorers on the Bruins were Geekie with 50 points (28 goals, 22 assists) in 72 games and Marchand with 47 points (21 goals, 26 assists) in 61 games before the trade to Florida.

Reasons for optimism
Jeremy Swayman: There was no question that Swayman underestimated how much missing training camp would impact his season. Not that he would likely change his decision after it resulted in an eight-year, $66 million contract ($8.25 million average annual value). Now, though, he has to live up to the deal. His past performance, albeit splitting time with former Vezina Trophy winner Linus Ullmark, indicates he should be far better than he was this season. The Bruins, however, will need to hope that by curtailing the number of times he starts three straight games -- an Achilles heel of his -- and by having him go through a full camp, he will be the player they had anticipated when he signed.
Trade Deadline haul: Understanding that the Bruins were not primed for a playoff run â even if they could have -- general manager Don Sweeney decided to sell off almost everything at the NHL Trade Deadline. In all, Boston acquired forward Fraser Minten, a 2026 first-round draft pick and a 2025 fourth-round selection from the Toronto Maple Leafs in return for Brandon Carlo, a 2027 conditional second-round pick from the Florida Panthers for Marchand, forwards Casey Mittelstadt and William Zellers and a 2025 second-round pick from the Colorado Avalanche for Charlie Coyle, forwards Marat Khusnutdinov and Jakub Lauko and a 2026 sixth-round draft pick from the Minnesota Wild for Justin Brazeau and defenseman Max Wanner, a 2025 second-round draft pick and a 2026 fourth-round draft pick from the Edmonton Oilers for Trent Frederic and Max Jones. It was a restocking the Bruins hope can push their retool forward.
David Pastrnak: Heâs unlikely to receive Hart Trophy consideration given where the Bruins are and other candidates for the award, but Pastrnak has pulled them along sometimes single-handedly. His 94 points are 44 more than the next-highest total, Geekie, and he has done it playing on a line mostly with the latter and Pavel Zacha. And while Geekie and Zacha are nice players, neither comes close to approaching the line that Pastrnak once starred on with Marchand and Patrice Bergeron. Pastrnak has taken on some added leadership as the only player remaining in the lineup with a letter, with Marchand traded and McAvoy injured, and his he has clearly led with his play on the ice. Pastrnak, who turns 29 next month, is still very much in his prime.

The Philadelphia Flyers failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the fifth consecutive season.
They were eliminated from contention when they lost 3-2 at the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday.
The Flyers' postseason drought matches its longest ever, when it failed to qualify for five straight seasons between 1989-90 and 1993-94. They rebounded to reach the playoffs 11 straight seasons and 16 of the next 17.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Flyers and why things could be better next season.

Potential unrestricted free agents: Rodrigo Abols, F; Olle Lycksell, F; Givani Smith, F
Potential restricted free agents: Noah Cates, F; Tyson Foerster, F; Jakob Pelletier, F; Cam York, D

What went wrong
Power-less power play
The Flyers' power play is 30th (14.9 percent) and it could be the fourth straight season it's been in the bottom three of the League. Among the struggles this season were the lack of a center who could consistently win face-offs to maintain possession. Philadelphia has won 48.8 percent of power-play face-offs, 29th in the NHL. There also has been a constant shuffling of players on the two units, leading to a lack of cohesion.
Goaltending
Philadelphia's .888 save percentage at 5-on-5 is the lowest in a season since the stat began being tracked in 2009-10. Samuel Ersson has had stretches where he looked like a No. 1 goalie, including an eight-game run from Dec. 28 to Jan. 21 when he went 7-1-0 with a .935 save percentage, and he earned a spot with Sweden at the 4 Nations Face-Off. He's allowed at least three goals in 12 of 13 starts since the 4 Nations break, and among the 41 goalies to play at least 30 games, Ersson is 40th in save percentage (.881) and 34th in goals-against average (3.15). Backups Ivan Fedotov (.881 save percentage, 25 games) and Aleksei Kolosov (.870, 15 games) haven't proven to be reliable options.
March of losses
The Flyers began March with a 2-1 shootout victory at the Winnipeg Jets and then lost 11 of their next 12 (1-10-1). They went 1-6-0 during a seven-game homestand, getting outscored 30-11, then were swept on a five-game road trip (0-4-1) that ended with them allowing seven goals in back-to-back games against the Chicago Blackhawks and Toronto Maple Leafs. Two days after a 7-2 loss to the Maple Leafs on March 25, coach John Tortorella was fired and replaced by assistant Brad Shaw.
Reason for optimism
Michkov's development
Matvei Michkov has grown to become the significant piece of the Flyers' rebuilding effort they were hoping for when they selected the forward with the No. 7 pick of the 2023 NHL Draft. The 20-year-old leads rookies with 24 goals and is second with 58 points in 75 games. Away from the ice, the native of Perm, Russia, has improved his English enough that he doesn't need to rely on a translator when talking with teammates or coaches.
Prospects are coming
Several top prospects have taken steps in their development and could be in line for NHL spots late this season or next season. Forward Jett Luchanko, the No. 13 pick of the 2024 NHL Draft, was a surprise addition to the opening-night roster and impressed in four games, and after a strong season with Guelph of the Ontario Hockey League (56 points; 21 goals, 35 assists in 46 games), he's gaining more professional experience finishing his season with Lehigh Valley of the American Hockey League. Forward Alex Bump, a fifth-round pick (No. 133) in the 2022 NHL Draft, helped Western Michigan University reach the Frozen Four with a team-leading 47 points (23 goals, 24 assists) in 40 games. Also ready for the next steps are forward Denver Barkey (2023, No. 95), defenseman Oliver Bonk (2023, No. 22) and goalies Carson Bjarnason (2023, No. 51) and Egor Zavragin (2023, No. 87).
Draft capital
The Flyers have three picks in the first round of the 2025 NHL Draft, theirs along with the Colorado Avalanche and the Edmonton Oilers. They also have four picks in the second round. Those seven selections give general manager Daniel Briere and his staff lots of options while they look to help the Flyers take another step in their rebuild, either using those choices to stockpile talent or in trades for more established players ready to provide help sooner.

WASHINGTON -- Alex Ovechkin proved Friday that he will not set the NHL goals record by scoring into an empty net.
"I tell 'Carbs' (Capitals coach Spencer Carbery) right away, 'I don't want to do it,' " Ovechkin said.
The empty net was there for Ovechkin on Friday, wide open and waiting for the Washington Capitals forward to make history, for him to score goal No. 895, to set the record for most goals all time, to become the NHL's undisputed goal-scoring king.
But Ovechkin didn't take the bait late in a 5-3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks at Capital One Arena.
Ovechkin won't go on the ice to score in a 5-on-6 situation until after he scores his record-breaking 895th goal with a goalie in the crease.
He can reach that milestone as soon as Sunday, when the Capitals play the New York Islanders at UBS Arena (12:30 p.m. ET; TNT, MAX, truTV, MNMT, SN360, TVAS).
"I appreciate that," Carbery said. "We have six games left and he wants to break the record and have that moment be where he's shooting a puck past a goalie."

The Blackhawks gave Ovechkin the chance at 895 and his 33rd NHL hat trick by pulling goalie Spencer Knight with just under two minutes left in the third period Friday.
Ovechkin didn't move from his spot on the bench when Knight came off the ice on the fly.
He did hop over the boards to go to the other side of the bench during a Chicago timeout after the Capitals iced the puck at 18:17.
The fans noticed and started to cheer, but when it was time to start play again, Ovechkin had to go back on the bench because forwards Nic Dowd, Andrew Mangiapane and Ryan Leonard were on the ice when Washington iced the puck. By rule they had to stay in the game.
However, at no point after Knight was pulled did Ovechkin get the urge to go on the ice, holding firm in his conviction that he doesn't want to set the NHL all-time goals record with an empty-net goal even though he has already scored an NHL-record 65 of them.
"'Stromer' [Dylan Strome] ask me, 'Carly' [John Carlson] ask me, everybody ask me, 'Do you want it? Do you want it?' " Ovechkin said. "I said, 'Let's wait.'"
Carbery still wanted to be sure on Friday, so he questioned Ovechkin when the situation came up, thinking nobody would blame him if he wanted the chance considering he was at home, he had dozens of family members in the building, and it could have completed a hat trick.
"I just wanted to confirm and make sure that he didn't want to go out," Carbery said. "It's hard because for us as coaches I just want to make sure that, are you sure in this moment, you know, hat trick, at home, and he didn't want to go out and score on an empty net to break the record."

Gretzky was surprised when Ovechkin told him during their joint postgame press conference that he won't score his 895th goal into an empty net.
"OK," Gretzky said, smiling. "I'll take every empty-net goal I can get. I know you would too."
Not this one.
Instead, Ovechkin had a front row seat for Leonard's first NHL goal. He scored it into the empty net at 18:24.
"I'm happy for 'Leno,' " Ovechkin said. "He scored his first NHL goal. The kid has a great future."
Ovechkin, though, had no problem going back on the ice after Leonard scored for a two-goal lead and the Blackhawks put Knight back in net. In fact, he stayed on the ice for the last 1:36 of the game, generating three scoring chances but being officially credited for just one shot on goal.
"You could tell he was determined to find a way to score a goal there," Carbery said.
Ovechkin joked that it wasn't his fault.
"I have pretty good chances in the last minute," Ovechkin said. "If 'Stromer' give me a nice pass, like a flat one, it would be probably be in."
Maybe that happens Sunday, a flat pass from Strome to Ovechkin for a one-timer into the back of the net to make history.
That's certainly possible, only if a goalie is in the crease.
"I have a lot of appreciation for that," Carbery said.

WASHINGTON -- John Carlson moved the puck to Alex Ovechkin and watched history happen from the left face-off circle.
And as soon the puck went into the net at 6:13 of the third period, Ovechkin tying Wayne Gretzky for the NHL's all-time goals record with his 894th, a one-timer from the place well known as his office, Carlson pulled out an old Ovechkin celebration move.
He jumped into the glass, just like Ovechkin has done after scoring so many of his 894 goals, before joining the celebration that eventually included every Capitals player, a giant celebration scrum in the left corner.
As much as this was Ovechkin's moment, hockey history being made at Capital One Arena in a 5-3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks on Friday with Gretzky in the building to watch the drama unfold, this too was also a major moment for Carlson.
In fact, in many ways it was fitting that Carlson had the primary assist on Ovechkin's record-tying goal. He is the second-most senior Capitals player behind Ovechkin, having been in Washington and teammates with Ovechkin since making his NHL debut on Nov. 20, 2009.

The Washington Capitals defenseman has played the second-most games with Ovechkin at 1,032, behind only Nicklas Backstrom's 1,059. He has the second-most assists on his 894 goals with 158, including his two on Friday, behind Backstrom's 279.
"I just think some things are meant to be and maybe that was just meant to be," Carlson said. "I've played with him the longest here that's playing tonight. It's a cool thing to have. You ask anybody they'd all say they'd be begging for it. I'm thrilled. I don't take it lightly. I think it's a special moment for us two that have been together for so long."
Carlson's role in the historic moment wasn't lost on his teammates and Capitals coach Spencer Carbery.
"One hundred thousand percent," center Dylan Strome said. "He's got the second-most assists on his goals. Very fitting. And from his office too. Just very fitting. Johnny was dishing all night tonight. He had the legs going. Very well deserving."
Carbery said he's had a sense that Ovechkin's chase for the record and the fact that he caught Gretzky on Friday has meant just a little bit more to Carlson and forward Tom Wilson because of their history with Ovechkin.
Wilson has been with the Capitals since the start of the 2013-14 season. He, Carlson, Ovechkin and Lars Eller are the four players on the team now that also played on the 2018 Stanley Cup winning team.
Eller, though, was traded out of Washington during the 2022-23 season before being brought back in a trade this season.
Carlson and Wilson are his longest-tenured active teammates.
"Having been with 'O' and been through this journey for so many years it means a little bit more to (Carlson and Wilson) because they've been riding right beside 'O' and they've won a Stanley Cup with him and they've been through the grind, been in the trenches with him," Carbery said. "I hope and I know they will sit back and appreciate the fact that they had massive impacts on this record and they played huge roles in 'O' being able to achieve that. I really appreciate that John's right in there on that goal because he has made a lot of great plays to 'O.' That's special that Johnny factors in on that goal."

Ovechkin certainly appreciated it too. He didn't mention Carlson specifically by name, but he did say getting to where he is now wouldn't have happened without players like him.
"Without my boys, I would never reach that milestone," Ovechkin said.
Carlson said making the moment greater for him is that he will get to share it with his own family, that his kids and future grandkids and great-grandkids can now watch Ovechkin's historic goal and see him in the picture, passing the puck to help Ovechkin make history.
"In the grand scheme of things everybody wants to be that person, but he scores a lot so you can't be on the ice all the time," Carlson said. "So I think you take it with a grain of salt, but when you do get into that position it is special. It's a special memory for me and my family. This night would be extremely memorable regardless but certainly that's a nice touch after so many years with the guy.
"I think from a friendship standpoint it's a nice touch obviously for me to be involved in it. I think he'd probably say the same."

WASHINGTON -- Alex Ovechkin bowed to Wayne Gretzky after tying his NHL goals record.
All thatâs left for the encore is for Ovechkin to pass him.
With Gretzky watching from a suite in Capital One Arena on Friday, Ovechkin scored his 893rd and 894th goals to equal âThe Great Oneâ for the most in NHL history in the Washington Capitalsâ 5-3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks.
âI'm still a little shaking and still can't believe it,â Ovechkin said. âIt's nice that my family is here, my mom, my wife, my kids, father-in-law, lots of friends came from lots of different cities. It's history. It's great for the game. It's great to do it here. It's special.â
After failing to convert on multiple chances late in the game for his record-breaking 895th goal, Ovechkin will next have the opportunity to make history when the Capitals visit the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Sunday (12:30 p.m. ET; MAX, MNMT, truTV, TNT, SN360, TVAS).
âI'm so proud that we're tied,â Gretzky said. âI can live with that for 24 more hours. I can still say I'm tied for the most.â

Ovechkin pulled to within one of Gretzky by scoring 3:52 into the first period to give Washington a 1-0 lead. On his second shift of the game, the 39-year-old slipped away from Chicago defenseman Alex Vlasic and received a pass from Dylan Strome, who was behind the net, for a one-timer from the inside edge of the right circle. The shot clanked off the far post before hitting goalie Spencer Knight on the back and dropping over the goal line.
When the goal counter in the corner of Capital One Arena was changed from 892 to 893, Gretzky applauded from his seat next to NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman while the sellout crowd of 18,573 roared with delight.
âEvery goal seems to get bigger and bigger and bigger,â Strome said. âThe crowd was incredible. Everyone knew what was happening and to get the one early, and then just a matter of time before he got another.â
The Capitals trailed 3-2 entering the third period before tying it on a power-play goal at 3:46, which was credited to Strome after Blackhawks defenseman Connor Murphy accidently knocked the rebound of his shot into the net.
Ovechkin was nearby, though, so many in the crowd celebrated thinking heâd scored No. 894.
But if there was any disappointment when the fans learned the goal was Stromeâs, it didnât last long. With the Capitals again on a power play, defenseman John Carlson fed Ovechkin for one of his signature one-timers from the left circle that screamed into the net short side on Knight at 6:13 for the record-tying goal.
"It is a relief, obviously,â Ovechkin said. âI just talked to my family yesterday and my father-in-law ask, 'How do you keep your energy, your mind?' And I just said like, 'I just enjoy it,' because it's a huge opportunity. It's history. It's lots of attention. Itâs friends love it, you guys love it, and it's great for the city and it's great for hockey because you turn on every sport channel and we're talking about a hockey game.
âWe're talking about Wayne Gretzky, Alex Ovechkin, Sidney Crosby, Mario Lemieux and Gordie Howe. I think for kids and for a whole generation, it's huge.â

The Capitals flooded off their bench to celebrate with Ovechkin near the spot where he scored, and the Blackhawks players stood and tapped their sticks in appreciation along with the cheering crowd. Ovechkin skated over to high-five his 6-year-old son, Sergei, and father-in-law, Kirill Shubsky, through the glass before skating to Chicago's blue line and waving to his mother, Tatyana, wife, Nastya, and 4-year-old son, Ilya, in the crowd.
He then turned toward the suite where Gretzky was sitting, pointed to him and bowed.
âI'm always going to be grateful for it, and thanks to Wayne (for) how he support me, how he always give me advice to be patient, don't put yourself in a stress position,â Ovechkin said. âI'm happy right now. I don't know what's my feelings going be tomorrow, but right now I'm happy.â
Gretzky had been alone atop the NHL goals list since scoring his 802nd to surpass Gordie Howe while playing for the Los Angeles Kings against the Vancouver Canucks at the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles on March 23, 1994. He scored his 894th while playing for the New York Rangers against the Islanders at Madison Square Garden on March 29, 1999, before retiring at the end of that season.
âFirst of all, it was a pleasure to be here,â Gretzky said. â... We always talk about our game, the players who were in it, from Gordie Howe, Bobby Orr, Mario Lemieux, (Mark) Messier, on and on. And we wonder, âOK, what's going to happen when those guys retire?â And along came Sidney Crosby and Alex Ovechkin.
âAlex has been so great for the city of Washington, he's been so great for the National Hockey League, and he's encouraged so many kids in his home country of Russia to play the sport of hockey. He's been nothing but a champion.â

Ovechkin revealed that Gretzky texted him before the game saying, âscore three,â and he tried his best to fulfill that request, other than declining when coach Spencer Carbery asked if he wanted to go on the ice to try to break the record with an empty-net goal after the Blackhawks had pulled Knight for an extra attacker.
Instead, after rookie forward Ryan Leonard scored into the empty net for his first NHL goal at 18:24 to increase Washingtonâs lead to 5-3, Ovechkin played the final 1:36 with Knight back in Chicago's net. Ovechkin had at least three good scoring chances during that final shift, including a shot from the slot that went off Knightâs shoulder and out of play with 1:15 remaining.
Knight offered his congratulations with the rest of the Blackhawks, who lined up to shake Ovechkinâs hand after the final horn.
âHe was like, âThanks, brother,â something like that,â Knight said. âI said, âOh, thank you for not scoring on me the last one.â Itâs cool to see. I think we all know that itâs not a matter of if, itâs when.â
Gretzky visited the Capitals locker room after the game and took a photo with the entire team. Gretzky later posed for another photo with Ovechkin, his sons and the puck from his 894th goal.
âIt's a special moment,â Ovechkin said. âIt's great for hockey, it's great for D.C., it's great for all our fans to do it here in Washington. It's fun. It's fun. It's always a pleasure to be in that category with those names.
âThank you, Wayne, for your support, for your kindness. It's great."
Gretzky finished his career with 894 goals in 1,487 games over 20 NHL seasons. Ovechkin, meanwhile, has 894 goals in 1,486 games over his 20 NHL seasons entering what could be the final act of his chase in New York.
âSee you Sunday,â Gretzky said.

WASHINGTON -- Wayne Gretzky was in the building to witness history Friday, watching from a suite at Capital One Arena as Alex Ovechkin scored twice to tie his all-time goals record of 894.
Gretzky will be in the building for No. 895 too, the one that will break the record that has stood for 31 years and make the Washington Capitalsâ 39-year-old forward the official and undisputed greatest goal-scorer in NHL history.
It could happen Sunday against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena (12:30 p.m. ET; MAX, MNMT, truTV, TNT, SN360, TVAS).
Gretzky's reason for why he wants to be present when Ovechkin makes history is simple, as he explained during the first intermission of the Capitalsâ 5-3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks.
"The integrity of the game," Gretzky said. "When I was breaking Gordie Howe's record, he was there. And I said two years ago that if Alex gets close to my record, I'll be here. That's the National Hockey League, right? (Jean) Beliveau to Howe, (Bobby) Orr, (Mario) Lemieux, (Mark) Messier, you pass it down. If somebody breaks Alex's record, I hope Alex is there to shake his hand. But, right now, I hope Alex enjoys it and he deserves all the credit and accolades he's getting."

Gretzky broke Howe's record of 801 goals on March 23, 1994, when he scored his 802nd against the Vancouver Canucks.
He said he doesn't remember exactly what Howe said to him other than, "I'm proud of you."
He does, however, remember exactly what his father, Walter, told him that night.
"My dad told me that same night, âBe as proud of the guy that breaks your record,â" Gretzky said.
Gretzky's pride in and admiration for Ovechkin was pouring out of him as he talked not long after Ovechkin scored his 893rd goal at 3:52 of the first period.

He scored No. 894 with a one-timer on the power play at 6:13 of the third period to give Washington a 4-3 lead. The goal stood up as the game-winner, making Ovechkin the NHL's all-time leader in game-winning goals with 136. He was tied with Jaromir Jagr.
âAlex has been so great for the city of Washington,â Gretzky said after the game. âHe's been so great for the National Hockey League. And he's encouraged so many kids in his home country of Russia to play the sport of hockey. He's been nothing but a champion and I'm so proud that we're tied. I can live with that for 24 more hours. I can still say I'm tied for the most.â
Ovechkin waved and bowed to Gretzky when he scored his 894th.
"Wayne texted me before the game,â Ovechkin said. âHe said, âScore three.â Yeah. It's a special moment. It's great for hockey. It's great for D.C. It's great for all our fans to do it here in Washington. It's fun. It's fun. It's always a pleasure to be in that category with those names. Thank you, Wayne, for your support, for your kindness. It's great."
Gretzky marvels at Ovechkin's consistency, especially the fact that his first goal Friday was his 40th of the season, extending his NHL record for most 40-goal seasons to 14.
Gretzky had at least 40 goals in each of his first 12 seasons, but didnât do so after. His last 40-goal season came in 1990-91, when he was 30 years old. Ovechkin is the first player in NHL history with at least three 40-goal seasons at the age of 35 or older. He also scored 50 in 2021-22 and 42 in 2022-23.

He has 41 with six games remaining.
"I remember when he [got to 800] and he went a couple games without scoring and I called him and I said, 'Hey, you've got to relax out there,'" Gretzky said. "And he's like, 'You know, I'm pressing.' And I said, 'For most people, that's 20 games without a goal.' For him, it was [four] games without a goal. I said, 'Just relax, you're going to get 900 goals before you know it.'"
Gretzky is proud of how Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby have carried the torch from players such as Messier, Lemieux and, although he didn't name himself, him too, of course.
"We always wonder what's going to happen when guys like Gordie Howe and Bobby Orr retire, when Mario Lemieux and Mark Messier retire, and then along came Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby," Gretzky said. "They've had a tremendous rivalry. They want to beat each other and yet they have mutual respect for each other. So proud of the fact that they've both won Stanley Cups. That's what our game is all about. It started back in the â40s and â50s, how you treat people and how you treat your community. Alex and Sidney have been great for not only Pittsburgh and Washington but for North America and for Alex especially over in Europe and Russia. There's not enough good words that you can say. This is all a positive."

Moreover, Gretzky is proud of how Ovechkin has handled the record chase, the integrity he has played with and the focus he has kept on the team and helping the Capitals try to secure first place in the Metropolitan Division and the top seed in the Eastern Conference going into the Stanley Cup Playoffs.
"That's probably more exciting, or as exciting, than what he's doing," Gretzky said. "The team from two years ago having a tough year, last year barely getting in and they're an unexpected great team this year, and their coaching staff and their management and their ownership, they deserve a lot of credit. They've put a lot of energy and juice back into the game of hockey in Washington. Listen, my hat goes off to them. It's fun to watch. My kids and I, we watch all the games and they're fun to watch."
He'll keep watching them in person until Ovechkin breaks his record.
It could happen Sunday.
"Two years ago when people said to me, 'Do you think Alex is going to break the record?' I said, 'It's not a matter of it, it's a matter of when,'" Gretzky said. "And when he does, Iâm going to be there. And so Iâm here."

ARLINGTON, Va. -- A hat trick for history.
Alex Ovechkin needs three goals to break Wayne Gretzky's all-time goals record of 894, and the Washington Capitals forward could achieve the feat as soon as Friday, against the Chicago Blackhawks at Capital One Arena (7 p.m. ET; CHSN, MNMT, NHLN, SN, TVAS).
"I think what's happening right now it's great for hockey, great for D.C.," Ovechkin said Friday morning. "Yeah, it's pretty cool."
Ovechkin has 32 hat tricks in his NHL career, including two this season. He has 15 goals in 25 games against the Blackhawks and reached the 800-goal milestone with a hat trick at Chicago on Dec. 13, 2022.
He has also scored in three straight games and in four of his past five to get to 892 for his career.
"Every goal feels more and more and more, and you almost catch yourself, like, 'OK, how many more away is he?' " Washington center Dylan Strome said. "This will be the first game we're going into where we're like, 'Yeah, it can really happen tonight.' Especially with him, if he gets one in the first period, he's just on a different level."

If it happens Friday, Gretzky will be in the building to witness the historic moment. He is expected to join NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and the NHL's traveling party Friday in Washington.
"It's bigger than the game right now," Capitals forward Tom Wilson said. "It's bigger than hockey. It's 'The Great One.' No one ever thought it would happen."
Gretzky is planning to be at every game from Friday until Ovechkin breaks his record. The Capitals' next game is against the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Sunday.
"It's great," Ovechkin said. "He's been supportive all the time to me. It's a fun time right now. We'll see what's going to happen, but right now all the attention is on hockey. It's a pretty cool moment."
As big as the moment is, as much hype and buzz as there is around it, Ovechkin is doing his best to stay as cool and composed as ever.

He was noticeably loose during Washington's morning skate Friday and during his post-skate media availability outside the Capitals dressing room at MedStar Capitals Iceplex.
"I'm always in a good mood, man," Ovechkin said, smiling.
Ovechkin had a long conversation with coach Spencer Carbery before the morning skate began. The two of them were smiling and at times laughing during their chat as Ovechkin stretched and began to get loose skating around the ice.
Carbery later said they talked about the number of family members Ovechkin has staying with him, how many tickets he had to secure for the game, and then a little about Xs and Os related to some lineup and line changes Washington is making in advance of playing Chicago.
"As he's inched closer to the record," Carbery said, "I know you would think is it now about scoring those last couple of goals, and it's not, really. It's about process oriented stuff, what he's doing on his off day. I saw him in here yesterday, he was getting in some work on the off day. And then it's just talking about what he and his family did for dinner, stuff like that."
Ovechkin was greeted by some former teammates when he came off the ice.
Braden Holtby, Nicklas Backstrom, T.J. Oshie, Brooks Orpik and Devante Smith-Pelly, all members of the Capitals' 2018 Stanley Cup championship team, were at the morning skate and will be at the game Friday as part of an initiative to celebrate the team's 50th anniversary season.
Backstrom and Oshie are expected to join the Capitals at home and on the road until Ovechkin breaks the record.
"Lots of support right here now," Ovechkin said. "Obviously, I miss [Backstrom] on the ice, but it's nice to have him around. 'Osh,' all of them."
They're no different than everyone else. Their anticipation is building. They know the moment is not far away now.
A hat trick for history on a Friday night in D.C.
"Sounds great," Wilson said. "Obviously, easier said than done, but I've learned you just don't doubt him. It's pretty special what I've been able to witness my whole career here. You never doubt it.
"The minute anyone says, 'Ah, that won't happen,' or 'He won't do it,' it usually happens. You never know. He'll be buzzing."

The Anaheim Ducks failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the seventh consecutive season.  
The Ducks (33-34-8) were eliminated when they lost 4-1 to the Calgary Flames on Thursday.
Anaheim won the Stanley Cup in 2007 and qualified for the playoffs 11 of 13 seasons between 2005-06 and 2017-18. The Ducks advanced to the Western Conference Final in 2015, where they lost in seven games to the Chicago Blackhawks, and in 2017, losing in six games to the Nashville Predators.
Here's a look at what happened in the 2024-25 season for the Ducks and why things could be better next season.
The skinny
Potential unrestricted free agents: Robby Fabbri, F; Ville Husso, G; Oliver Kylington, D; Brock McGinn, F
Potential restricted free agents: Sam Colangelo, F; Lukas Dostal, G; Drew Helleson, D; Brett Leason, F; Isac Lundestrom, F; Mason McTavish, F; Nikita Nesterenko, F
Potential 2025 Draft picks: 9
What went wrong
Tough start: It wasn't good out of the gate for the Ducks, who went 5-8-2 through the first month of the season (Oct. 12-Nov. 13). It left the Ducks eighth in the Pacific Division at the time, and left them too big a hole to climb out of as they attempted to get back into the postseason race.
Special teams woes: The Ducks have struggled in special teams play on both sides. Their power play is 31st in the NHL (12.5 percent), ahead only of the New York Islanders (12.4 percent), and their penalty kill is 28th in the League (73.5 percent).
Lack of scoring: The Ducks have struggled to muster offense in any situation, averaging 2.69 goals per game this season, tied with the Chicago Blackhawks for 27th in the League. Granted, that is higher than last season's average of 2.48 goals per game (30th in the League). Nevertheless, their scoring leader is forward Troy Terry with 52 points (19 goals, 33 assists) in 70 games; he's the only Ducks player with more than 50 points this season.
Reasons for optimism
Leo Carlsson: The No. 2 pick in the 2023 NHL Draft, Carlsson has looked much more comfortable in his second season in Anaheim. The 20-year-old center especially has been good since returning from the 4 Nations Face-Off, where he played for Sweden. Since then, he has 21 points (11 goals, 10 assists) in 21 games. Prior to the 4 Nations break, he had 19 points (nine goals, 10 assists) in his first 48 games of the season.
Mason McTavish: In his fourth NHL season, the 22-year-old center has set NHL career highs in goals (20), assists (28) and points (48) in 69 games. His previous best in points was 2022-23, when he had 43 points (17 goals, 26 assists) in 80 games. McTavish had his most productive month in March, when he had 14 points (six goals, eight assists) in 15 games. The No. 3 pick in the 2021 NHL Draft continues to be steady.
Young defense group: The Ducks have four defensemen who will be 24 years old or younger entering next season: Jackson LaCombe, 24; Olen Zellweger, 21; Pavel Mintyukov, 21 and Drew Helleson, 24. LaCombe especially has made great strides this season. After finishing with 17 points (two goals, 15 assists) and a minus-24 rating in 71 games last season, he has 43 points (14 goals, 29 assists) and a minus-1 rating in 68 games this season. Heâs also averaging 22:00 of ice time per game, up from 19:23 last season.

Jason Robertson was always considered an exceptionally smart player, which laid the foundation for NHL success.
Once other parts of his game were polished, the Dallas Stars forward was able to develop into the offensive gem he is today.
âJason Robertson, when I first got to him in Texas, one thing that jumped out right away was his hockey IQ,â said Derek Laxdal, Robertsonâs first coach in the American Hockey League and former assistant with Dallas. âHis ability to circumvent a play or to think outside the box off a rush -- below the goal line, shooting off the end wall, shooting off a pad, shooting off the net, passing to himself at full speed -- was incredible.
âHe came up to us after junior and he wasnât in the best shape, but he invested in himself to go up to (former NHL forward) Gary Robertsâ (conditioning camp), and the transformation that he had with his body and his physical stature was incredible. That gave him his chance.â
Robertson was selected by the Stars in the second round (No. 39) of the 2017 NHL Draft after having 81 points (42 goals, 39 assists) in 68 games as a 17-year-old with Kingston of the Ontario Hockey League. Now in his fifth full season with Dallas, the 25-year-old has 77 points (33 goals, 44 assists) in 75 games.
A foot injury slowed Robertson at the beginning of the season, but heâs caught fire since the start of 2025. He has 24 goals dating to Jan. 1, tied with David Pastrnak of the Boston Bruins for the second-most in the League in that span, one behind Leon Draisaitl of the Edmonton Oilers.
Robertson has an opportunity to add to his totals when the Stars host the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday (3 p.m. ET; ABC, ESPN+, TVAS).
âItâs obviously pretty remarkable,â said younger brother Nicholas Robertson, a forward with the Toronto Maple Leafs. âIt wasnât really handed to him right away. He had to play in the American League and then on the fourth line and then got an opportunity due to injuries, and thatâs when he started to grow.â

Robertson played two additional seasons in junior after he was drafted by Dallas. He began his professional career in 2019-20 with Texas of the AHL under Laxdal, who is now coach of Coachella Valley.
âI had him his first year coming into pro with Texas and it was a bit of a struggle for him, the pace and the demands of the season,â Laxdal said. âIt was interesting. He hadnât scored very early in the season, but once he got his first goal you could just see everything start to come together offensively for him. Then he just takes off.â
Robertson had 47 points (25 goals, 22 assists) in 60 games for Texas in 2019-20. Laxdal was with Texas through early December that season before becoming a Stars assistant under Rick Bowness.
Robertson went to Stars training camp the following season looking to earn a spot on the roster but got off to a rocky start.
âWe were having training camp scrimmage, and he didnât go in to forecheck on a puck,â Laxdal said. âHe actually backed away from the puck and then we sat him out. We didnât play him for five games until he understood he has to go in and compete for pucks. When we put him back in there, he just went on a tear, and he never looked back. So you could see that once he finds and gets comfortable at the level that heâs in, you can see what he can do.â
A quick study, Robertson had 45 points (17 goals, 28 assists) in 51 games for Dallas in 2020-21 as a rookie. He had 79 points (41 goals, 38 assists) in 74 games the following season and was off and running.
âOnce he established that he was an NHL player, we just saw the natural talent,â Laxdal said. âI think for him, when he was in Dallas, he was insulated very well with Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski, who played an important part of developing that role with him now. Now that Joe is gone, I think he realizes he can be just as effective without him on his line.â

Robertson broke out with 109 points (46 goals, 63 assists) in 82 games in 2022-23. His production dipped last season with 80 points (29 goals, 51 assists) in 82 games, but heâs back to averaging well over a point per game since the calendar turned to 2025, with 49 points (25 assists) in 39 games.
He had 28 points (nine goals, 19 assists) in 36 games through Dec. 31.
âWith my foot surgery over the summer, it took me a little time to get back into it,â Robertson said. âI really rushed to get back. Thereâs a lot of confidence out there now, and a lot of players, not just me have that now. A couple of guys in our room had slower first halves and then really turned on in the second, and I think itâs contagious. You see a guy like [Wyatt Johnston] on fire right now, you see a guy like [Thomas Harley] on fire right now. Guys lead by example and everyone feeds of it.â
Robertson admitted he felt pressure to play well early in the season hoping to be selected to represent the United States in the 4 Nations Face-Off in February. Not being named to the team proved to be a weight off his shoulders.
Robertson is expected to be in contention to make the U.S. roster for the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics.
âMy play wasnât good enough regardless of the foot injury or not,â Robertson said. âI know I couldnât have done better, and when I saw it didnât happen and I didnât make it -- it wasnât a relief, I obviously wanted to make it -- but it was relief I could flush that away, focus on playing hockey with your team and not worry about the other stuff.
âThat was definitely an interesting part of the season, but I think after that I started to realize that I can focus my time on the team, and I can focus on trying to get back to full health and try to be the player I can be for this team.â
It is safe to say Robertson is back, and heâs expected to be a key figure for Dallas in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Stars (50-21-4), who have clinched a playoff berth, are second in the Central Division, four points behind the Winnipeg Jets with a game in hand.
âI think once he got healthy and caught up, youâre seeing now what heâs capable of doing,â Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. âI think now heâs on pace from that point on to be that 100-point, 40-goal guy that he is. He has elite IQ and elite finishing ability. He makes it look easy the way he releases the puck and the patience he has in those scoring areas where a lot of guys rush shots, he has the patience to wait an extra second and find a hole.â

TORONTO -- How do the Toronto Maple Leafs replicate this?
How do their well-known and well-paid stars, Mitch Marner and Auston Matthews and William Nylander and John Tavares, take the gritty, grinding yet effective blueprint -- the "not pretty stuff", as forward Matthew Knies called it -- of their 3-2 victory against the Florida Panthers Wednesday, and successfully implement it in just more than two weeks when the Stanley Cup Playoffs start?
Those questions won't be answered until the postseason officially kicks off later this month. And it won't be until then that the Maple Leafs season will be judged as either a success or a failure.
The win clinched a postseason berth for Toronto for a ninth consecutive time, meaning Marner, Matthews and Nylander have been in the playoffs every season since they started playing together in 2016.
Yet, in that time, the group has won only one series. In fact, the Maple Leafs elimination of the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games in the 2023 Eastern Conference First Round was the only time they've done it since 2004, a span of 21 years.
Enter Craig Berube, who was hired as coach last summer with the intention of changing the team's fortunes by changing its style. Fancy hockey, complete with highlight reel goals, were great for artistic merit but not so much for postseason success.
As such, he preached the type of north-south, straight-ahead style the St. Louis Blues used as their recipe to win the Stanley Cup in 2019 when he was their coach. All that remained was to gauge if Toronto's so-called big boys would buy into what he was selling.
From what the coach saw against the Panthers, they have.
"It's hard to make the playoffs," Berube said. "It's a tough league. It's tight. But our team, I think, has played very consistent this year, did a really good job of changing their style of play and playing a certain way and adapting to it over time.

"It doesn't happen overnight. It takes a while. But they've learned to figure it out with the different areas of the game and scoring and things like that.
"It's been a pleasure."
Especially when the big guns answer the call at both ends of the ice like they did against the Panthers.
Make no mistake. This was a Florida team that was missing some of its top players in forwards Matthew Tkachuk (lower body), Aleksander Barkov (upper body), and defensemen Aaron Ekblad (suspension) and Dmitry Kulikov (upper body). That's a talented chunk of the Panthers roster that didn't lace up.
At the same time, Berube was quick to point out that Toronto has been forced to play without some of its own key cogs earlier this season, most notably Matthews who missed 15 games with an upper body injury. In this league, the coach said, you play the hand you're dealt.
And now, with the Maple Leafs battling with the Panthers and Lightning for the top spot in the Atlantic, it was Matthews, Marner, Nylander and Tavares who stepped up.
It was Nylander who set up Tavares for Toronto's first goal in the second period to tie the game 1-1. Matthews then fed Marner for the goal ahead goal in the third. Marner followed with a great pass that sprung Knies for a breakaway goal that gave Toronto a 3-1 lead, one they would never relinquish.
But with all that said about Marner's offensive heroics, it was his defensive prowess in the final minutes while the Maple Leafs were holding a 3-2 lead that pleased his coach the most. At one point, the Toronto forward leapt in the air to bat down a puck, then dove to swat it out of the Toronto zone and relieve the pressure.
Whatever it takes.
"Our big guys, they're not just there to score," Berube said. "They're there to play 200-foot hockey, whether it's penalty killing, protecting the lead, just playing good defense.
"You need that from everybody. Doesn't matter who it is. You need guys who bought in to sacrificing and to play the other side of the puck."
Which is exactly what Knies saw from Toronto's elite players, especially with the clock ticking down and the game on the line.

"You saw in the last minute and a half," he said. "They stay out there and kill it and put it along the wall at the very end of the game. So, it's important for those guys to do that kind of thing and step up for us.
"It's fun to watch, to be honest. It's really cool for them to do stuff like that. You know, the not-pretty stuff."
The victory kept Toronto in first place entering Thursday with 96 points, three ahead of Tampa Bay and four in front of Florida. Tampa Bay has a game in hand on each team. It kicked off an eight-day span from April 2-9 in which the Maple Leafs play the Panthers twice (also April 8) and Lightning once (April 9). Tampa Bay and Florida will meet on April 15, the final regular-season game for the Panthers.
Winning these head-to-head matchups will go a long way for one of these three teams to finish in first in the division. Do that, and the odds favor a potential first-round series against the Ottawa Senators. The second and third-place teams, meanwhile, will have the unenviable task of playing each other.
Toronto won the first leg Wednesday. In the process, they know they now have better odds of controlling their own fate and not relying on other teams to help.
"To win games, you have to do everything it takes," said goalie Anthony Stolarz, who was on the Panthers last season. "We're going to need that kind of sacrifice (in the playoffs). I'm liking what I'm seeing out of the boys right now."
So does Marner.
"We stuck with it," he said.
It's a game plan for success they followed in what proved to be a key win in early April.
Whether they can stay disciplined enough to follow it up later this month once the Stanley Cup Playoffs starts, well, that remains to be seen.
